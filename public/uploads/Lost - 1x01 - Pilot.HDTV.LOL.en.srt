1
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,438
Somebody help me out!

2
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:12,192
Oh, my god!

3
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:25,122
  

4
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,793
Walt! Walt!

5
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,713
Stay away from the gas! Stay there!

6
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:44,808
Help! Help!

7
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,685
Somebody help me!

8
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,191
Help! Help!

9
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:56,904
My leg!

10
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:03,827
Hey, get over here! Give me a hand!

11
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:07,831
You! Come on! Come over here! Give me a hand!

12
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,833
On the count of 3!

13
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:10,751
1...

14
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,127
2...

15
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:13,879
3!

16
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,146
Help!

17
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:36,693
Please! Help me! Help me! Help me!

18
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,073
All right, get him out of here!
Get him away from the engine!

19
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,824
Get him out of here!

20
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,834
I'm having contractions.

21
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,753
- How many months pregnant are you?
- I'm eight months.

22
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,380
And how far apart are they coming?

23
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,173
I don't know. I think it just happened.

24
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:02,803
Hey! Hey, hey, get away!

25
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:16,650
    

26
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,359
Listen to me.

27
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,611
Look at me. You're gonna be okay, do you understand me?

28
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,864
But you have to sit absolutely still.

29
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,953
Hey, you!

30
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,246
Come here!

31
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,415
I need you to get this woman away from these fumes.

32
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,083
Take her over there. Stay with her.

33
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,587
If her contractions occur any closer than three minutes apart, call out for me.

34
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,088
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

35
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,424
- I'll be  right back, okay?
- Thank you.

36
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,594
Hey! What's your name?!

37
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:45,804
Jack!

38
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,807
Stop.

39
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,935
Her head's not tilted far back enough.
You're blowing air into her stomach.

40
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:52,769
Are you sure?

41
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:54,980
That's exactly what I was doing.

42
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,315
I'm a lifeguard. I'm licensed.

43
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,151
Yeah, well, you need to seriously think about giving that license back.

44
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,361
Maybe we should do one of those hole things.

45
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,113
You know, stick that pen in the throat.

46
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,533
Yeah, good idea. You go get me a pen.

47
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,998
Does anyone have any pens?
Do you have a pen?

48
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:15,292
Come on.

49
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:21,924
Come on! Come on! Come on.

50
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,680
Big deep breaths.

51
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,640
Big breaths.

52
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,617
Move! Move! Move!

53
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,577
Get her out of there! The wing !

54
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,770
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

55
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:18,981
You?

56
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,191
Stay with her.

57
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,902
Dude, I'm not going anywhere.

58
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,704
I didn't know which one worked best.

59
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,047
They're all good.

60
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:26,507
Thanks.

61
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,399
Excuse me.

62
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,862
Did you ever use a needle?

63
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:14,781
What?

64
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,701
Did you ever patch a pair of jeans?

65
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:26,084
I made the drapes in my apartment.

66
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,045
That's fantastic. Listen,

67
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,381
do you have a second?
I could use a little help here.

68
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,055
Help with what?

69
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:40,057
With this.

70
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,309
Look, I'd do it myself. I'm a doctor,
but I just can't reach --

71
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,353
- You want me to sew that up?
- It'd be just like the drapes --

72
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,188
No, with the drapes, it was a sewing machine.

73
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,482
No, you can do this. I'm telling you.

74
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,275
If you wouldn't mind.

75
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,743
- Of course I will.
- Thank you.

76
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:06,959
It's for your hands.

77
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:11,922
Save me some.

78
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:14,967
For the-- for the wound.

79
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,640
Any color preference?

80
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:27,145
No. Standard black.

81
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:43,931
Hey, you.

82
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:45,807
What's your name?

83
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,851
Me? Charlie.

84
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:48,894
Charlie.

85
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,897
We need help with the fire.
No one will see it if it isn't big.

86
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,898
Okay, I'm on it.

87
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:53,899
What's your name?

88
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:56,151
- Sayid.
- Sayid. I'm on it, Sayid.

89
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,666
I might throw up on you.

90
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,377
You're doing fine.

91
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,049
You don't seem afraid at all.

92
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,386
I don't understand that.

93
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,555
Well,

94
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,348
fear's sort of an odd thing.

95
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,271
When I was in residency,

96
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:37,776
my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery
on a 16-year-old kid.

97
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,486
A girl.

98
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:46,201
And at the end, after 13 hours,
I was closing her up, and I --

99
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,872
I accidentally ripped her dural sac.

100
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,208
Shredded the base of the spine
where all the nerves come together.

101
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,544
Membrane, stenos tissue.

102
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,756
So it ripped open.

103
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:05,220
Nerves just spilled out of her
like angel hair pasta.

104
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:08,640
Spinal fluid flowing out of her, and I --

105
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:18,817
and the terror was just so... crazy.

106
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,819
So real.

107
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,032
And I knew I had to deal with it.

108
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,745
So I just made a choice.

109
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:34,291
I'd let the fear in. Let it take over.
Let it do its thing.

110
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:38,086
But only for five seconds.
That's all I was gonna give it.

111
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:40,297
So I started to count.

112
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:41,924
1...

113
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:43,425
2...

114
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:45,219
3...

115
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:46,970
4...

116
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:47,888
5.

117
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,559
Then it was gone.

118
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:58,148
I went back to work, sewed her up,
and she was fine.

119
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,860
If that had been me,

120
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,863
I think I would have run for the door.

121
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:08,659
Well, I don't think that's true.

122
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,120
You're not running now.

123
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,386
FATE

124
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,723
You'd think they would have come by now.

125
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,935
What? Who?

126
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:36,645
Anyone.

127
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,918
As if I'm gonna start eating chocolate.

128
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,548
Shannon, we may be here for a while.

129
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,800
The plane had a black box, idiot.

130
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:10,012
They know exactly where we are. They're coming.

131
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:14,892
I'll eat on the rescue boat.

132
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,770
I'll eat on the rescue boat!

133
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:33,911
- Hungry?
- Yeah. Thanks.

134
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:39,917
Any more, uh, you know, baby stuff?

135
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:43,504
No. I'm -- I'm okay.

136
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:51,178
- Well, hang in there.
- Yeah, you too.

137
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,359
You sure you're warm enough?

138
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:17,043
   

139
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:20,544
   

140
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:23,129
   

141
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:30,030
   

142
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,193
Do you think he's gonna live?

143
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,074
Do you know him?

144
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,494
He was sitting next to me.

145
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:10,257
We must have been at about
40,000 feet when it happened.

146
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:12,676
Hit an air pocket

147
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:15,387
and dropped maybe...

148
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,307
200 feet.

149
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:21,059
The turbulence was...

150
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,566
I blacked out.

151
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:31,653
I didn't.

152
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:34,406
I saw the whole thing.

153
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:41,663
I knew that the tail was gone, but I...

154
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:45,083
couldn't bring myself to look back.

155
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:48,504
And then the --

156
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,797
the front end of the plane broke off.

157
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,886
Well, it's not here on the beach.

158
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:57,971
Neither is the tail.

159
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:02,643
We need to figure out which way we came in.

160
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:03,644
Why?

161
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,812
'Cause there's a chance we could find the cockpit.

162
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:07,940
If it's intact, we might be able to find the transceiver,

163
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,399
and we could send a signal

164
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,985
and help the rescue party find us.

165
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:13,612
How do you know all that?

166
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:18,408
Took a couple flying lessons.

167
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:21,286
It wasn't for me.

168
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,167
I saw some smoke.

169
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:29,670
Just through the valley.

170
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,093
If you're thinking about going for the cockpit,

171
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,553
I'm going with you.

172
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:47,604
I don't know your name.

173
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:55,320
- I'm Kate.
- Jack.

174
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:13,422
What was that?

175
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,052
That was weird, right?

176
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:20,387
Is that Vincent?

177
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:22,681
It's not Vincent.

178
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:29,146
Did anybody see that ?

179
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:32,733
Yeah.

180
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,153
Boone!

181
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:10,479
Terrific.

182
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:26,620
So how's the drink?

183
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,915
It's good.

184
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,292
That wasn't a very strong reaction.

185
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:34,378
Well, it's not a very strong drink.

186
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:40,968
Just don't tell anyone.

187
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:44,263
This of course breaks some
critical FAA regulations.

188
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:16,461
Excuse me.

189
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:19,423
Sir, excuse me?

190
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:20,966
I guess he really had to go.

191
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,594
Sir, excuse me?

192
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,649
Ladies and gentlemen,

193
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:40,027
the pilot has switched on
the "fasten seatbelts" sign.

194
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:43,906
Please return to your seats
and fasten your seatbelts.

195
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:46,366
It's normal.

196
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,577
Oh, I know.

197
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,038
I've just never been a very food flyer.

198
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:53,582
My husband keeps reminding me that planes

199
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,626
want to be in the air.

200
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,669
Well, he sounds like a very smart man.

201
00:22:57,753 --> 00:23:00,756
I'll be sure and tell him that
when he gets back from the bathroom.

202
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:09,556
Well, I'll keep you company until he does.

203
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:11,934
Don't worry.

204
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:13,060
It's gonna be over.

205
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,434
It sounded like an animal.

206
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:56,353
That sound that it made,

207
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,064
I keep thinking that there was
something really familiar about it.

208
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:00,774
- Where are you from?
- The Bronx.

209
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:03,694
- Might be monkeys.
- Sure. It's monkey island...

210
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:06,738
You ready?

211
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:15,706
Kate, you showed me where the smoke was.
I can get there myself.

212
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:16,790
I'm coming.

213
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,421
Well, you're gonna need better shoes.

214
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,193
Whatever it was,

215
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:27,861
it wasn't natural.

216
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:30,364
Does anyone have any sunblock ?

217
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:31,949
Yeah, I do.

218
00:25:32,815 --> 00:25:34,368
So,

219
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:37,287
I was just looking inside the fuselage.

220
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:39,540
It's pretty grim in there.

221
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:42,125
Do you think we should do
something about the, uh...

222
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:46,630
B-o-d-y-s?

223
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:50,133
What are you spelling, man, bodies?

224
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:51,844
B-o-d-I-e-S.

225
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:53,846
That sounds like a good idea.

226
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:56,890
No, they'll deal with it when they get here.

227
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:59,393
I'm gonna go out and look for the cockpit.

228
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:00,853
See if we can find a transceiver

229
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:03,480
to send a distress signal, help the rescue team.

230
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:05,774
You're gonna need to keep
an eye on the wounded.

231
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:07,276
If the guy in the suit wakes up,

232
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:08,569
try to keep him calm,

233
00:26:08,694 --> 00:26:11,947
but don't let him remove that piece of shrapnel.
You understand?

234
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:14,449
Yeah. Got it. What about the guy with the leg, the tourniquet?

235
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:15,993
Stopped the bleeding. I took it off last night.

236
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:18,245
He should be all right.

237
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:20,998
Yeah. Cool. Good job.

238
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:23,750
I'll come with. I want to help.

239
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:24,835
Nah, I don't need any more help.

240
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:28,589
No, it's cool. Don't really feel
like standing still, so...

241
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:32,342
Excellent.

242
00:26:39,183 --> 00:26:40,392
Can I ask you something?

243
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:41,727
Me?

244
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:43,103
I'd be thrilled.

245
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,730
I've been waiting.

246
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:47,357
Have we ever met anywhere?

247
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:50,652
No. That would be unlikely.

248
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:54,780
- I look familiar, though, right?
- Yeah.

249
00:26:55,564 --> 00:26:58,247
- Can't quite place it?
- No, I can't.

250
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:01,205
Yeah. I think I know.

251
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,623
You do?

252
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:04,958
"you all, everybody

253
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,711
you all, everybody"

254
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:10,047
You never heard that song?

255
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:13,467
- I've heard it. I just don't know what the hell
- That's us... Driveshaft.

256
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:14,510
Look, the ring.

257
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:15,719
Second tour of Finland.

258
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:16,970
You never heard of Driveshaft?

259
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:18,764
- The band?
- Yeah, the band.

260
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:21,725
- You were in Driveshaft?
- I am. I play bass.

261
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,519
- Serious?
- Yeah. Charlie.

262
00:27:23,602 --> 00:27:24,978
Track 3, you know, I do backing vocals.

263
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:26,939
My friend Beth would freak. She loves you guys.

264
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:28,524
Give me Beth's number. I'll call her. I'd love to.

265
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:31,568
- Hey.
- You ever heard of Driveshaft?

266
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:33,654
 You all, everybody

267
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:36,490
 you all, every...body

268
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:38,700
we got to keep moving.

269
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:41,954
They were good.

270
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,372
They are good.

271
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,082
Still together.

272
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:47,751
In the middle of a comeback.

273
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:18,407
Hey, guys, is this normal?

274
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:21,994
Kind of day turning into night,

275
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:23,996
you know, end of the world-type weather.

276
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:25,080
Is this -- guys?

277
00:28:38,421 --> 00:28:40,971
I'm telling you, you don't wanna go in there!
There's too many bodies!

278
00:29:01,725 --> 00:29:03,243
There it is again.

279
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,038
Oh my god.

280
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:54,962
Well, let's do this.

281
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:36,545
- Let's get this trans--
- Transceiver.
- Transceiver thing and get out of here.

282
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:40,192
Come on! Come on!

283
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:48,283
You okay?

284
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:50,369
Yeah. You?

285
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:51,620
Yeah.

286
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:55,082
I'm fine.

287
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:57,084
Charlie's fine, by the way. I'm okay.

288
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,506
Hey, you don't have to come up here.

289
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:04,299
No, I'm good.

290
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:28,323
So, what does a transceiver look like?

291
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:30,492
Like a complicated walkie-talkie.

292
00:33:05,528 --> 00:33:08,864
Hey! Can you hear me?

293
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:12,451
I need that water.

294
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:20,792
Here. Here you go.

295
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:27,924
- How many survived?
- At least 48.

296
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:31,136
Does anything feel broken?

297
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:35,140
No, no. Just my head -- it's a little dizzy, that's all.

298
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:38,185
It's probably a concussion.

299
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:42,898
- How long has it been?
- 16 hours.

300
00:33:43,023 --> 00:33:43,899
16 --

301
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:50,405
- Has anybody come?
- Not yet.

302
00:33:54,076 --> 00:33:56,328
Six hours in,

303
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,624
our radio went out.

304
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:03,168
No one could see us.

305
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:07,548
We turned back to land in Fiji.

306
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:11,051
By the time we hit turbulence,

307
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:14,930
we were a thousand miles off course.

308
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:20,394
They're looking for us in the wrong place.

309
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:27,901
We have a transceiver.

310
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:30,487
Good. Good, that's what we were hoping.

311
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:33,323
- Listen, you shouldn't try to move.
- No, no. I'm okay.

312
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,200
The transceiver's right there.

313
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:36,535
It's right there.

314
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:44,751
Where's Charlie?

315
00:34:54,595 --> 00:34:55,596
It's not working.

316
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:03,687
Charlie?

317
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:10,152
What were you doing in the bathroom?

318
00:35:10,903 --> 00:35:11,612
What?

319
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:19,745
What the hell was that?

320
00:35:20,913 --> 00:35:21,622
Kate.

321
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:30,130
It's right outside.

322
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:31,590
What? What's right outside?

323
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,317
What the hell just happened?!

324
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,839
Jack, come on!

325
00:36:54,756 --> 00:36:55,674
Just leave it!

326
00:37:40,511 --> 00:37:41,470
Hey !

327
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:54,983
Run!

328
00:38:07,746 --> 00:38:08,747
Jack!

329
00:38:38,277 --> 00:38:38,861
1...

330
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:42,573
2...

331
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:44,908
3...

332
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,244
4...

333
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,456
5.

334
00:39:06,722 --> 00:39:07,014
Kate!

335
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:12,269
- Where the hell's Jack?
- I don't know!

336
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:13,729
- Did you see him?
- Yeah, he pulled me up.

337
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:14,813
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

338
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:16,773
- How can you not know?
- We got separated!

339
00:39:16,857 --> 00:39:19,860
Look, I fell down. He came back for me.
That thing was --

340
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:20,903
Did you see it ?

341
00:39:20,986 --> 00:39:22,946
No. No. But it was right there.

342
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:26,867
We were dead. I was, and then
Jack came back and he pulled me up.

343
00:39:26,992 --> 00:39:28,327
I don't know where he is.

344
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,256
- We have to go back for him.
- Go back? There?

345
00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:45,219
Kate, there's a certain gargantuan quality
about this thing.

346
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:46,803
Then don't come.

347
00:39:51,642 --> 00:39:52,100
Kate!

348
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:21,922
I heard you shout.

349
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:25,175
I heard you shout "Jack."

350
00:40:26,051 --> 00:40:27,845
I'm Charlie, by the way.

351
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,058
What is that?

352
00:40:58,917 --> 00:40:59,960
What --

353
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:01,044
It's the pilot.

354
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:10,596
Did you see it?

355
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:16,143
No. It was right behind me,
but I dove into the bushes.

356
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:18,020
Guys?

357
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:20,647
How do something like that happen?

358
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:31,213

Warning: spoilers on episode 2 are next.

359
00:41:32,149 --> 00:41:34,481
There are 2 bachelors to choose from.

360
00:41:34,573 --> 00:41:37,191
The season premiere of The Bachelor is next.

361
00:41:37,564 --> 00:41:38,462
   

362
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,617
  

363
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:43,036
Mayday ! Mayday !

364
00:41:43,268 --> 00:41:44,835
   

365
00:41:44,882 --> 00:41:46,497
I've just been through a trauma here. Okay ?

366
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,919
We've all been through a trauma.

367
00:41:48,057 --> 00:41:50,485
I haven't felt the baby move since yesterday.

368
00:41:50,624 --> 00:41:52,142
   

369
00:41:52,235 --> 00:41:52,612
Give it a break.

370
00:41:54,484 --> 00:41:56,434
I know your type.

371
00:41:56,994 --> 00:41:57,987
  

372
00:41:58,313 --> 00:41:59,833
You saw what that thing did to the pilot.

373
00:41:59,972 --> 00:42:02,446
What makes you think we're any safer here
than we are in the jungle ?

374
00:42:02,585 --> 00:42:05,442
If you see anything, run!

375
00:42:05,674 --> 00:42:07,100
What is that ?

376
00:42:07,238 --> 00:42:09,139
Something else is already transmitting.

377
00:42:09,419 --> 00:42:10,364
That's weird.

378
00:42:10,457 --> 00:42:11,593
What is she saying ?

379
00:42:13,229 --> 00:42:14,272
What is this ?

380
00:42:15,393 --> 00:42:16,388
Come here!

381
00:42:17,557 --> 00:42:18,195
Break it up!

382
00:42:18,242 --> 00:42:19,142
Come on! Bring it!

383
00:42:19,262 --> 00:42:20,968
Go on!

384
00:42:21,061 --> 00:42:21,628
Stop!

385
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:26,767
Something is coming.

386
00:42:26,906 --> 00:42:28,138
It's coming towards us I think.

387
00:42:30,196 --> 00:42:30,951
Let it go !

388
00:42:33,195 --> 00:42:35,239
Guys... where are we ?

389
00:42:35,379 --> 00:42:36,517
An all new Lost.

390
00:42:36,656 --> 00:42:37,362
Next Wednesday 8/7c

391
00:42:37,409 --> 00:42:39,692
only on ABC.
