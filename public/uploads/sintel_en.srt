00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,500
This blade has a dark past.

3
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,800
It has shed much innocent blood.

4
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,450
You're a fool for traveling alone,
so completely unprepared.

5
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,800
You're lucky your blood's still flowing.

6
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,300
Thank you.

7
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,000
So...

8
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,800
What brings you to
the land of the gatekeepers?

9
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,500
I'm searching for someone.

10
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,200
Someone very dear?
A kindred spirit?

11
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,000
A dragon.

12
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,750
A dangerous quest for a lone hunter.

13
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,870
I've been alone for
as long as I can remember.

14
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,500
We're almost done. Shhh...

15
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,500
Hey, sit still.

16
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,250
Good night, Scales.

17
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,850
Get him, Scales! Come on!

18
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,250
Scales?

19
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,500
Yeah! Come on!

20
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,000
Scales!

21
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,500
I have failed.

22
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,500
You've only failed to see...

23
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,500
These are dragon lands, Sintel.

24
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,000
You are closer than you know.

25
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,500
Scales!

26
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,000
Scales?

27
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,800
Scales...

28
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,060
