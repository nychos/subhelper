1
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,000
Sméagol!

2
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,300
I've got one!

3
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,900
I've got a fish, Sméag. Sméagol!

4
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on.
Pull it in.

5
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,300
Déagol!

6
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,500
Déagol?

7
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,300
Déagol.

8
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Give us that, Déagol, my love.

9
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,500
Why?

10
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,800
Because...

11
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,700
...it's my birthday and I wants it.

12
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,900
My precious.

13
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,400
They cursed us.

14
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,100
Murderer.

15
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,600
"Murderer" they called us.

16
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,500
They cursed us
and drove us away.

17
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,500
Gollum.

18
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,300
Gollum.

19
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,500
Gollum.

20
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,000
And we wept, precious.

21
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,700
We wept to be so alone.

22
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,100
--and cool
So nice for feet

23
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,400
And we only wish
To catch a fish

24
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,900
So juicy sweet

25
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,800
And we forgot the taste of bread...

26
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,600
...the sound of trees...

27
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,600
...the softness of the wind.

28
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,900
We even forgot our own name.

29
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:22,400
My precious.

30
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,000
Wake up!

31
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,800
Wake up!

32
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,700
Wake up, sleepies.

33
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,800
We must go, yes.

34
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,600
We must go at once.

35
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,300
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

36
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,000
I've gone and had too much.

37
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,100
Must be getting late.

38
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,800
No.

39
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,900
It isn't.

40
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,100
It isn't midday yet.

41
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,800
The days are growing darker.

42
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,300
Come on!

43
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,000
Must go! No time!

44
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,600
Not before Mr. Frodo's
had something to eat.

45
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,600
No time to lose, silly.

46
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,600
Here.

47
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,700
What about you?

48
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,200
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

49
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,200
Sam.

50
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,300
All right.

51
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,000
We don't have that much left.

52
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,000
We have to be careful
or we're going to run out.

53
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,100
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

54
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,700
I've rationed it.

55
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,900
There should be enough.

56
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,300
For what?

57
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,700
The journey home.

58
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,800
Come, Hobbitses.

59
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,100
Very close now.

60
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,400
Very close to Mordor.

61
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,400
No safe places here.

62
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,700
Hurry.

63
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,800
It's good.

64
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,400
Definitely from the Shire.

65
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
Longbottom Leaf.

66
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,400
I feel like I'm back at
The Green Dragon.

67
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,700
-Green Dragon.
-A mug of ale in my hand.

68
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,400
Putting my feet up on a settle
after a hard day's work.

69
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,600
Only, you've never done
a hard day's work.

70
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,400
Welcome, my lords...

71
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,900
...to lsengard!

72
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,000
You young rascals!
A merry hunt you've led us on...

73
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,000
...and now we find you feasting
and...and smoking!

74
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,400
We are sitting on a field of victory...

75
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,100
...enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

76
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,100
The salted pork is particularly good.

77
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,000
Salted pork?

78
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,600
-Hobbits.
-We're under orders from Treebeard...

79
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,600
...who's taken over management
of lsengard.

80
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,200
Young Master Gandalf.

81
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,900
I'm glad you've come.

82
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,500
Wood and water, stock and stone
I can master.

83
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,300
But there is a wizard to manage here...

84
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,500
... Iocked in his tower.

85
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,600
Show yourself.

86
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,500
Be careful.

87
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,000
Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.

88
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,300
Well, let's just have his head
and be done with it.

89
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
No.

90
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,100
We need him alive.

91
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,700
We need him to talk.

92
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,700
You have fought many wars
and slain many men, Théoden King...

93
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,500
...and made peace afterwards.

94
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,500
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

95
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,000
Can we not have peace, you and l?

96
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,100
We shall have peace.

97
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,200
We shall have peace...

98
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,200
...when you answer
for the burning of the Westfold...

99
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,200
...and the children that lie dead there!

100
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,100
We shall have peace
when the lives of the soldiers...

101
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
...whose bodies were hewn
even as they lay dead...

102
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,000
...against the gates of the Hornburg,
are avenged!

103
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:50,100
When you hang from a gibbet
for the sport of your own crows...

104
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,400
...we shall have peace.

105
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,900
Gibbets and crows?

106
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,500
Dotard!

107
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,700
What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?

108
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,300
Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.

109
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,300
Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dûr itself...

110
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,400
...along with the crowns of the seven kings
and the rods of the Five Wizards!

111
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,600
Your treachery has already cost
many lives.

112
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,200
Thousands more are now at risk.

113
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,700
But you could save them, Saruman.

114
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,200
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

115
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,600
So you have come here for information.

116
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,400
I have some for you.

117
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,800
Something festers
in the heart of Middle-earth.

118
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,200
Something that you have failed to see.

119
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,100
But the Great Eye has seen it.

120
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,900
Even now he presses his advantage.

121
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,000
His attack will come soon.

122
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
You're all going to die.

123
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,200
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

124
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,900
You cannot think that this Ranger
will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.

125
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:20,100
This exile, crept from the shadows,
will never be crowned king.

126
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,200
Gandalf does not hesitate
to sacrifice those closest to him...

127
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,400
...those he professes to love.

128
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,800
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Halfling...

129
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,100
...before you sent him to his doom?

130
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,100
The path that you have set him on
can only lead to death.

131
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,700
I've heard enough!

132
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,800
Shoot him.
Stick an arrow in his gob.

133
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,900
No.

134
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,600
Come down, Saruman...

135
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,700
-...and your life will be spared.
-Save your pity and your mercy.

136
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,300
I have no use for it!

137
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,900
Saruman...

138
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,100
...your staff is broken.

139
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,400
Gríma, you need not follow him.

140
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,300
You were not always as you are now.

141
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,300
You were once a Man of Rohan.

142
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,800
Come down.

143
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,600
A Man of Rohan?

144
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,800
What is the house of Rohan...

145
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,500
... but a thatched barn
where brigands drink in the reek...

146
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,500
...and their brats roll on the floor
with the dogs?

147
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:57,300
The victory at Helm's Deep does not
belong to you, Théoden Horse-master.

148
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,500
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

149
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,700
Gríma...

150
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,400
...come down.

151
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,200
Be free of him.

152
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,300
-Free? He will never be free.
-No.

153
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,400
Get down, cur!

154
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,400
Saruman!

155
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,200
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

156
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Tell us what you know!

157
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,500
You withdraw your guard, and I will tell you
where your doom will be decided.

158
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,300
I will not be held prisoner here.

159
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,100
Send word to all our allies...

160
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,000
...and to every corner of Middle-earth
that still stands free.

161
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,700
The enemy moves against us.
We need to know where he will strike.

162
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,800
The filth of Saruman...

163
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,900
... is washing away.

164
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,500
Trees will come back to live here.

165
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,300
Young trees.

166
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,600
-Wiild trees.
-Pippin!

167
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,300
Bless my bark!

168
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,400
Peregrin Took!

169
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,100
I'll take that, my lad.

170
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,200
Quickly, now.

171
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,800
Tonight we remember those who
gave their blood to defend this country.

172
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,700
Hail the victorious dead.

173
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,300
Hail!

174
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,200
No pauses.

175
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,400
-No spills.
-And no regurgitation.

176
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,600
So it's a drinking game?

177
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,900
Last one standing wins.

178
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,300
What'll we drink to?
Let's drink to victory!

179
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,800
To victory!

180
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,400
I am happy for you.

181
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,200
He is an honourable man.

182
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,100
You are both honourable men.

183
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:38,200
It was not Théoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

184
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,300
Don't listen to me.

185
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,600
You are young.

186
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,100
And tonight is for you.

187
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,200
Here, here.

188
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:16,400
It's the Dwarves that go swimming
with little, hairy women.

189
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,200
I feel something.

190
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,800
A slight tingle in my fingers.

191
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,200
I think it's affecting me.

192
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,800
What did I say?

193
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,200
He can't hold his liquor.

194
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,900
Game over.

195
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,500
Oh, you can search far and wide
You can drink the whole town dry

196
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,500
But you'll never find a beer so brown
But you'll never find a beer so brown

197
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:58,100
As the one we drink in our hometown
As the one we drink in our hometown

198
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,200
You can drink your fancy ales
You can drink 'em by the flagon

199
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,500
But the only brew for the brave and true

200
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,600
Pippin!

201
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,900
But the only brew for the brave and true

202
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,100
Comes from The Green Dragon

203
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,600
Thank you! I win!

204
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,900
No news of Frodo?

205
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,500
No word. Nothing.

206
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,600
We have time.

207
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,300
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

208
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Do we know that?

209
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,700
What does your heart tell you?

210
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,100
That Frodo is alive.

211
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,100
Yes.

212
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
Yes, he's alive.

213
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,900
Too risky. Too risky.

214
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,400
Thieves.

215
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,600
They stole it from us.

216
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,200
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

217
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,100
Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

218
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,800
Mustn't ruin it now.

219
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,000
But they knows.

220
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,100
They knows.

221
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,900
They suspects us.

222
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,500
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

223
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,300
Is Sméagol losing his nerve?

224
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,500
No. Not.

225
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,800
Never. Sméagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

226
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,800
Sméagol wants to see them dead.

227
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,600
And we will.

228
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,700
Sméagol did it once.
He can do it again.

229
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,800
It's ours!

230
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,600
Ours!

231
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,600
We must get the precious.
We must get it back.

232
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,200
Patience! Patience, my love.

233
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,700
First we must lead them to her.

234
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,500
We lead them to the Wiinding Stair.

235
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,400
Yes, the stairs. And then?

236
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,700
Up, up, up, up,
up the stairs we go...

237
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:39,100
...until we come to the tunnel.

238
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,700
And when they go in...

239
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,700
...there's no coming out.

240
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,400
She's always hungry.

241
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,400
She always needs to feed.

242
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,100
She must eat.

243
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,300
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

244
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,200
And they doesn't taste very nice,
does they, precious?

245
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,600
No.

246
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:08,200
Not very nice at all, my love.

247
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,300
She hungers for sweeter meats.

248
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,400
Hobbit meat.

249
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,200
And when she throws away the bones
and the empty clothes...

250
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,600
...then we will find it.

251
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,000
And take it for me!

252
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,300
For us.

253
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,700
Yes. We meant "for us."

254
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,300
Gollum. Gollum.

255
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,000
The precious will be ours...

256
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,700
...once the Hobbitses are dead!

257
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,800
You treacherous little toad!

258
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,800
No! No! Master!

259
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,600
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

260
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,100
I heard it from his own mouth.
He means to murder us.

261
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,300
Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

262
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,500
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

263
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,200
...who hates Sméagol...

264
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,200
...and who makes up nasty lies.

265
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,000
You miserable little maggot!
I'll stove your head in!

266
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,700
Sam!

267
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,400
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

268
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,100
-You scare him off, we're lost!
-I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

269
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,500
-I won't wait around for him to kill us!
-I'm not sending him away.

270
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,200
You don't see it, do you?

271
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,100
He's a villain.

272
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,600
We can't do this by ourselves, Sam.
Not without a guide.

273
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,400
I need you on my side.

274
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,600
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

275
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,000
I know, Sam. I know.

276
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,600
Trust me.

277
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,100
Come, Sméagol.

278
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,500
What time is it?

279
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,400
Not yet dawn.

280
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,300
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

281
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,400
...climbing over green lands
and above the hills.

282
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,200
I stood upon the brink.

283
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,200
It was utterly dark in the abyss
before my feet.

284
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,000
A light shone behind me...

285
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,000
...but I could not turn.

286
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,600
I could only stand there, waiting.

287
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,700
Night changes many thoughts.

288
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,400
Sleep, Éowyn.

289
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,100
Sleep...

290
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,700
...while you can.

291
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,200
The stars are veiled.

292
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,600
Something stirs in the east.

293
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,500
A sleepless malice.

294
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,300
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

295
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,300
What are you doing?

296
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,500
Pippin!

297
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,800
Pippin?

298
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,000
Pippin.

299
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,300
-What, are you mad?
-I just want to look at it.

300
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
Just one more time.

301
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,900
Put it back.

302
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,000
Pippin.

303
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,000
No!

304
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,400
Pippin.

305
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,900
He is here.

306
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,300
I see you.

307
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,000
Pippin!

308
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,300
Help! Gandalf, help!

309
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,000
Someone help him!

310
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,600
Pippin!

311
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,000
Fool of a Took!

312
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,200
Look at me.

313
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:02,300
Gandalf, forgive me.

314
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,400
Look at me.

315
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,400
What did you see?

316
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
A tree.

317
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,800
There was a white tree...

318
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,500
...in a courtyard of stone.

319
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,600
It was dead.

320
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,600
The city was burning.

321
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,100
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

322
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,800
I saw....

323
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,600
I saw him.

324
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,800
I could hear his voice in my head.

325
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,400
And what did you tell him?

326
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,400
Speak!

327
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,800
He asked me my name.
I didn't answer.

328
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,400
He hurt me.

329
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,000
What did you tell him
about Frodo and the Ring?

330
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,000
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

331
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,100
A fool...

332
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,600
...but an honest fool he remains.

333
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,500
He told Sauron nothing
of Frodo and the Ring.

334
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,900
We've been strangely fortunate.

335
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,000
Pippin saw in the palantír
a glimpse of the enemy's plan.

336
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,900
Sauron moves to strike
the city of Minas Tirith.

337
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,100
His defeat at Helm's Deep
showed our enemy one thing.

338
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,700
He knows the heir of Elendil
has come forth.

339
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

340
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,900
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

341
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,100
Sauron fears this.

342
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,400
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

343
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,200
He will raze Minas Tirith
to the ground...

344
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,800
...before he sees a king
return to the throne of Men.

345
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,800
If the beacons of Gondor are lit,
Rohan must be ready for war.

346
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,000
Tell me...

347
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,900
...why should we ride to the aid
of those who did not come to ours?

348
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,700
What do we owe Gondor?

349
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,800
-I will go.
-No!

350
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,100
-They must be warned.
-They will be.

351
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,200
You must come to Minas Tirith
by another road.

352
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,100
Follow the river.
Look to the black ships.

353
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,200
Understand this:

354
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,800
Things are now in motion
that cannot be undone.

355
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
I ride for Minas Tirith...

356
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,400
...and I won't be going alone.

357
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,800
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

358
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,600
Hurry! Hurry!

359
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,500
Where are we going?

360
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,900
Why did you look?

361
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,800
Why do you always have to look?

362
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,000
-I don't know. I can't help it.
-You never can.

363
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,900
I'm sorry, all right?

364
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,900
-I won't do it again.
-Don't you understand?

365
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,600
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

366
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,500
He's going to be looking for you, Pip.
They have to get you out of here.

367
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,600
And you--? You're coming with me?

368
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,300
Merry?

369
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,800
Come on.

370
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,700
How far is Minas Tirith?

371
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,400
Three days' ride, as the Nazgûl flies.

372
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,000
And you better hope we don't have
one of those on our tail.

373
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,300
Here.

374
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,300
Something for the road.

375
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,100
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

376
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,200
I know you've run out.
You smoke too much, Pippin.

377
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,900
But-- But we'll see each other soon.

378
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,800
-Won't we?
-I don't know.

379
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,900
I don't know what's going to happen.

380
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,700
-Merry.
-Run, Shadowfax.

381
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,300
Show us the meaning of haste.

382
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,400
Merry!

383
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Merry!

384
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,000
He's always followed me...

385
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,700
...everywhere I went...

386
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,900
...since before we were tweens.

387
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,800
I would get him into
the worst sort of trouble...

388
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,100
...but I was always there to get him out.

389
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,500
Now he's gone.

390
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,100
Just like Frodo and Sam.

391
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,400
One thing I have learned about Hobbits:

392
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,300
They're a most hardy folk.

393
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,400
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

394
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,300
Take her by the safest road.

395
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,000
A ship lies anchored
in the Grey Havens.

396
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,000
It waits to carry her across the sea.

397
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,600
The last journey of Arwen Undómiel.

398
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,200
There is nothing for you here...

399
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,900
...only death.

400
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,600
Lady Arwen...

401
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,400
...we cannot delay.

402
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,200
My lady!

403
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,100
-Tell me what you have seen.
-Arwen.

404
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,200
You have the gift of foresight.

405
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,200
What did you see?

406
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,100
I looked into your future,
and I saw death.

407
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,900
But there is also life.

408
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,700
You saw there was a child.
You saw my son.

409
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,900
That future is almost gone.

410
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,100
But it is not lost.

411
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,900
Nothing is certain.

412
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,300
Some things are certain.

413
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,000
If I leave him now...

414
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,800
... I will regret it forever.

415
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,200
It is time.

416
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,100
From the ashes a fire shall be woken

417
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,800
A light from the shadow shall spring

418
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,300
Renewed shall be blade that was broken

419
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,900
The crownless again shall be king

420
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,700
Re-forge the sword.

421
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,300
Your hands are cold.

422
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,700
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

423
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,100
This was my choice.

424
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,300
Whether by your will or not...

425
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,800
...there is no ship now
that can bear me hence.

426
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,900
We've just passed
into the realm of Gondor.

427
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,800
Minas Tirith.

428
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,700
City of kings.

429
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,900
Make way!

430
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,000
It's the tree.

431
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,700
Gandalf. Gandalf.

432
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,100
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

433
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,200
The tree of the king.

434
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,000
Lord Denethor, however,
is not king.

435
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,800
He is a steward only,
a caretaker of the throne.

436
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,000
Now listen carefully.
Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.

437
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,400
To give him news of his beloved son's
death would be most unwise.

438
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,300
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

439
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,000
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

440
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,700
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

441
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:54,200
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

442
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,500
I come with tidings in this dark hour,
and with counsel.

443
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,900
Perhaps you come to explain this.

444
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:19,000
Perhaps you come to tell me
why my son is dead.

445
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,500
Boromir died to save us...

446
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,400
...my kinsman and me.

447
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,000
-He fell defending us from many foes.
-Pippin.

448
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,000
I offer you my service, such as it is...

449
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,700
...in payment of this debt.

450
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,000
This is my first command to you.

451
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:03,200
How did you escape
and my son did not...

452
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,900
...so mighty a man as he was?

453
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,900
The mightiest man
may be slain by one arrow...

454
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,100
...and Boromir was pierced by many.

455
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,000
Get up.

456
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,600
My lord, there will be a time
to grieve for Boromir...

457
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,900
...but it is not now.

458
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,800
War is coming.

459
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:32,500
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

460
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,900
...with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

461
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,900
You still have friends.
You are not alone in this fight.

462
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,600
Send word to Théoden of Rohan.
Light the beacons.

463
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,800
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

464
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,000
Yet for all your subtleties,
you have not wisdom.

465
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,200
Do you think the eyes
of the White Tower are blind?

466
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,500
I have seen more than you know.

467
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,900
Wiith your left hand you would use me
as a shield against Mordor.

468
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,000
And with your right
you'd seek to supplant me.

469
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:14,800
I knowwho rides with Théoden of Rohan.

470
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:20,900
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

471
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:25,900
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

472
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:30,600
... Iast of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship.

473
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,500
Authority is not given to you
to deny the return of the king, steward.

474
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,200
The rule of Gondor is mine
and no other's.

475
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,200
Come.

476
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,700
All has turned to vain ambition.

477
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,400
He would even use his grief
as a cloak.

478
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,000
A thousand years
this city has stood.

479
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,600
Now, at the whim of a madman,
it will fall.

480
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,000
And the White Tree,
the tree of the king...

481
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,700
...will never bloom again.

482
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,200
-Why are they still guarding it?
-They guard it because they have hope.

483
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,500
A faint and fading hope
that one day it will flower.

484
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:28,400
That a king will come
and this city will be as it once was...

485
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,600
... before it fell into decay.

486
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,000
The old wisdom borne out
of the West was forsaken.

487
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,300
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

488
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,600
...and counted the old names
of their descent...

489
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:44,500
...dearer than the names of their sons.

490
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,600
Childless lords sat in aged halls,
musing on heraldry...

491
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,100
...or in high, cold towers,
asking questions of the stars.

492
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,200
And so the people of Gondor
fell into ruin.

493
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,600
The line of kings failed.

494
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,600
The White Tree withered.

495
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,400
The rule of Gondor was given over
to lesser men.

496
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,500
Mordor.

497
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:26,600
Yes, there it lies.

498
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,800
This city has dwelt ever
in the sight of its shadow.

499
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,500
A storm is coming.

500
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,000
This is not the weather of the world.

501
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,400
This is a device of Sauron's making.

502
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:44,300
A broil of fume
he sends ahead of his host.

503
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,400
The Orcs of Mordor
have no love of daylight...

504
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,400
...so he covers the face of the sun...

505
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,300
...to ease their passage
along the road to war.

506
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,700
When the Shadow of Mordor
reaches this city...

507
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,200
...it will begin.

508
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,400
Well...

509
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,200
... Minas Tirith...

510
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,500
...very impressive.

511
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,300
-So where are we off to next?
-Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.

512
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,600
There's no leaving this city.

513
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:18,200
Help must come to us.

514
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,400
It must be getting near teatime.

515
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,200
Leastways, it would be in decent places
where there is still teatime.

516
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,000
We're not in decent places.

517
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,900
Mr. Frodo?

518
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,100
What is it?

519
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,900
It's just a feeling.

520
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,500
I don't think I'll be coming back.

521
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,600
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

522
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,100
That's just morbid thinking.

523
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,000
We're going there and back again...

524
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,400
...just like Mr. Bilbo.

525
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,500
You'll see.

526
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,200
I think these lands were once
part of the kingdom of Gondor.

527
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,700
Long ago, when there was a king.

528
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,200
Mr. Frodo, look.

529
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,600
The king has got a crown again.

530
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,900
Come on, Hobbits!
Mustn't stop now. This way.

531
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,800
So I imagine this is just
a ceremonial position.

532
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:37,300
I mean, they don't actually expect me
to do any fighting.

533
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,400
-Do they?
-You're in the service of the steward now.

534
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,900
You'll have to do as you're told,
Peregrin Took.

535
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,500
Ridiculous Hobbit.

536
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,900
Guard of the Citadel.

537
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,200
Thank you.

538
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,800
There's no more stars.

539
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,600
Is it time?

540
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,500
Yes.

541
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,800
It's so quiet.

542
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:31,900
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

543
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,000
I don't want to be in a battle...

544
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,800
... but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

545
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:49,000
Is there any hope, Gandalf,
for Frodo and Sam?

546
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,400
There never was much hope.

547
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,200
Just a fool's hope.

548
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,800
Our enemy is ready.

549
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,800
His full strength's gathered.

550
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,400
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

551
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,500
Legions of Haradrim from the south...

552
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,500
...mercenaries from the coast.

553
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,200
All will answer Mordor's call.

554
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,000
Come on.

555
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,400
This will be the end of Gondor
as we know it.

556
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,900
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

557
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,100
If the river is taken,
if the garrison at Osgiliath falls...

558
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,000
...the last defense of this city
will be gone.

559
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,300
But we have the White Wiizard.
That's got to count for something.

560
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:51,800
Gandalf?

561
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:59,100
Sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant...

562
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:03,300
...the one who will lead
Mordor's armies in war.

563
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:08,600
The one they say no living man can kill.

564
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,000
The Wiitch King of Angmar.

565
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,400
You've met him before.

566
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,600
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

567
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,900
He is the lord of the Nazgûl...

568
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,800
...the greatest of the Nine.

569
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:34,500
Minas Morgul is his lair.

570
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,600
The Dead City.

571
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:46,900
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

572
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,400
Quick. Quick.

573
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:00,500
They will see. They will see.

574
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:15,000
Come away. Come away.
Look, we have found it.

575
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,100
The way into Mordor.

576
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,600
The secret stair.

577
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,500
Climb.

578
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,400
-No, Mr. Frodo!
-Not that way!

579
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,100
-What's it doing?
-No.

580
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,500
-They're calling me.
-No.

581
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,000
Hide! Hide!

582
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:19,400
I can feel his blade.

583
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,300
We come to it at last.

584
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,000
The great battle of our time.

585
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:20,400
Come away, Hobbits.
We climb. We must climb.

586
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,200
The board is set.

587
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,900
The pieces are moving.

588
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,100
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

589
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,100
And then it's into the tunnel.

590
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:47,400
Hey, what's in this tunnel?

591
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,600
You listen to me,
and you listen good and proper.

592
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,800
Anything happens to him,
you have me to answer to.

593
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,600
One sniff something's not right...

594
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:58,900
...one hair stands up
on the back of my head, it's over.

595
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,800
No more slinker. No more stinker.

596
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,700
You're gone. Got it?

597
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,600
I'm watching you.

598
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,000
What was that about?

599
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,500
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

600
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,000
Peregrin Took, my lad,
there is a task now to be done.

601
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:31,600
Another opportunity for one
of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

602
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,200
You must not fail me.

603
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,500
It's been very quiet across the river.

604
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,000
The Orcs are lying low.

605
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,200
The garrison may have moved out.

606
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,000
We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.

607
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:27,500
If the Orcs attack from the north,
we'll have some warning.

608
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,000
Quiet.

609
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,100
We need 1 0 more.

610
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:22,900
Kill him!

611
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,700
They're not coming from the north.

612
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:48,300
To the river. Quick. Quick.
Go. Come on.

613
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,400
Faster.

614
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,900
Draw swords.

615
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,100
Hold! Hold them!

616
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,300
What?

617
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,300
Amon Dîn.

618
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:51,000
The beacon.
The beacon of Amon Dîn is lit.

619
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:58,400
Hope is kindled.

620
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:35,200
The beacons of Minas Tirith!
The beacons are lit!

621
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,200
Gondor calls for aid.

622
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,500
And Rohan will answer.

623
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,700
Muster the Rohirrim.

624
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,800
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

625
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:16,200
As many men as can be found.
You have two days.

626
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:21,700
On the third,
we ride for Gondor and war.

627
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,200
-Forward.
-Very good, sir.

628
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,600
-Gamling.
-My lord.

629
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:27,400
Make haste
across the Riddermark.

630
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:29,700
Summon every able-bodied man
to Dunharrow.

631
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,500
I will.

632
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,600
-Wiill you ride with us?
-Just to the encampment.

633
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:42,700
It's tradition for the women
of the court to farewell the men.

634
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,300
The men have found their captain.

635
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,600
They will follow you into battle,
even to death.

636
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,500
You have given us hope.

637
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,700
Excuse me.

638
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:04,500
I have a sword.

639
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,200
Please accept it.

640
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:11,700
I offer you my service, Théoden King.

641
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:17,300
And gladly I accept it.

642
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:22,300
You shall be Meriadoc,
esquire of Rohan.

643
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:28,600
Horse-Men.

644
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:34,700
I wish I could muster a legion of Dwarves,
fully armed and filthy.

645
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:38,100
Your kinsmen may have no need
to ride to war.

646
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:41,800
I fear war already marches
on their own lands.

647
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,700
So it is before the walls
of Minas Tirith...

648
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,700
...the doom of our time will be decided.

649
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:15,800
Now is the hour.
Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

650
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:19,500
Now, fulfill them all.
To lord and land!

651
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,600
Faramir!

652
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,500
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

653
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:18,300
Tell the men to break cover.
We ride for Minas Tirith.

654
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,300
Nazgûl.

655
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,200
Take cover!

656
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,900
Nazgûl!

657
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:40,600
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

658
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,200
Fall back!

659
01:11:56,300 --> 01:12:00,700
-Retreat! Retreat!
-Run for your lives!

660
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:29,300
The age of Men is over.

661
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:35,100
The time of the Orc has come.

662
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,900
-Keep going.
-It's the Nazgûl.

663
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,800
Take cover, my lord!

664
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:45,600
It's coming!

665
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:54,400
-It's Mithrandir.
-The White Rider!

666
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:35,800
Pull!

667
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,900
Mithrandir.

668
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,900
They broke through our defenses.

669
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,200
They've taken the bridge
and the west bank.

670
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:05,400
-Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.
-lt is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

671
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:10,100
-Long has he foreseen this doom.
-Foreseen and done nothing.

672
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,000
Faramir?

673
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,700
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

674
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:24,200
No.

675
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,000
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

676
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,200
-Where? When?
-ln lthilien.

677
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,500
Not two days ago.

678
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:38,300
Gandalf, they're taking the road
to the Morgul Vale.

679
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,800
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

680
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,400
What does that mean?

681
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:51,400
-What's wrong?
-Faramir, tell me everything.

682
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,700
Tell me all you know.

683
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,200
This is how you would serve your city?

684
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:01,600
You would risk its utter ruin?

685
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:04,400
I did what I judged to be right.

686
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:08,000
What you judged to be right.

687
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:14,500
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor
in the hands of a witless Halfling.

688
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:23,300
It should have been brought back
to the Citadel to be kept safe.

689
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:26,500
Hidden.

690
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:29,700
Dark and deep in the vaults...

691
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
... not to be used.

692
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:41,000
Unless at the uttermost end of need.

693
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,600
I would not use the Ring.

694
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:46,800
Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin
and I alone could save her.

695
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:51,900
Ever you desire to appear lordly
and gracious...

696
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,400
...as a king of old.

697
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:59,900
Boromir would have remembered
his father's need.

698
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,900
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

699
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:05,600
Boromir would not
have brought the Ring.

700
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:09,100
He would have stretched out his hand to
this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.

701
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,500
-You know nothing of this matter!
-He would have kept it for his own.

702
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,600
And when he returned...

703
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,400
...you would not have known your son.

704
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:21,100
Boromir was loyal to me!

705
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,800
Not some wizard's pupil!

706
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,400
Father?

707
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:47,900
My son.

708
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:15,600
Leave me.

709
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,600
Careful, master. Careful.

710
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,900
Very far to fall.

711
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:01,300
Very dangerous are the stairs.

712
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:06,500
Come, master.

713
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:15,500
Come to Sméagol.

714
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,400
Mr. Frodo.

715
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,000
Get back, you!

716
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,300
Don't touch him!

717
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:35,200
Why does he hates poor Sméagol?

718
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:39,100
What has Sméagol ever done to him?

719
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,700
Master?

720
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,900
Master carries heavy burden.

721
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:51,400
Sméagol knows.
Heavy, heavy burden.

722
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,900
Fat one cannot know.

723
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:59,700
Sméagol look after master.

724
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:03,200
He wants it.

725
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:07,800
He needs it.
Sméagol sees it in his eye.

726
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:13,300
Very soon he will ask you for it.
You will see.

727
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:17,500
The fat one will take it from you.

728
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,000
Send forth all legions.

729
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:33,200
Do not stop the attack
until the city is taken.

730
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:37,100
Slay them all.

731
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:44,500
-What of the wizard?
-I will break him.

732
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:50,400
Where are Théoden's riders?

733
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:53,100
Wiill Rohan's army come?

734
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,500
Mithrandir.

735
01:19:56,700 --> 01:20:00,400
Courage is the best defense
that you have now.

736
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,000
What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?

737
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:15,600
What service can a Hobbit
offer such a great lord of Men?

738
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,400
It was well-done.

739
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:24,600
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.

740
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,900
You are to join the tower guard.

741
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:31,400
I didn't think they would find any livery
that would fit me.

742
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,100
Once belonged to a young boy
of the city.

743
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,900
A very foolish one...

744
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:40,100
...who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

745
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:43,100
-This was yours?
-Yes, it was mine.

746
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,100
My father had it made for me.

747
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:47,600
Well...

748
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,700
... I'm taller than you were then.

749
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:53,100
Though I'm not likely to grow anymore,
except sideways.

750
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,200
Never fitted me either.

751
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,200
Boromir was always the soldier.

752
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:06,600
They were so alike, he and my father.

753
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,400
Proud.

754
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,700
Stubborn even.

755
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,000
But strong.

756
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:19,600
I think you have strength
of a different kind.

757
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:22,600
And one day your father will see it.

758
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,600
Here do I swear fealty
and service to Gondor...

759
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,400
... in peace or war...

760
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:35,400
...in living or dying...

761
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:38,100
...from....

762
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,500
From this hour henceforth...

763
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,600
... until my lord release me...

764
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:49,300
...or death take me.

765
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,400
And I shall not forget it...

766
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:55,900
...nor fail to reward
that which is given.

767
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,800
Fealty with love.

768
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:08,600
Valour with honour.

769
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:13,500
Disloyalty with vengeance.

770
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:26,200
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

771
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:29,200
...defenses that your brother
long held intact.

772
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,800
-What would you have me do?
-I will not yield...

773
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,800
...the river in Pelennor unfought.

774
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,600
Osgiliath must be retaken.

775
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:38,800
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

776
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,300
Much must be risked in war.

777
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,800
Is there a captain here who still has
the courage to do his lord's will?

778
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:58,300
You wish now that our places
had been exchanged...

779
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,100
...that I had died
and Boromir had lived.

780
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:07,400
Yes.

781
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:10,200
I wish that.

782
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:21,100
Since you were robbed
of Boromir...

783
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,800
... I will do what I can
in his stead.

784
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:38,300
If I should return,
think better of me, Father.

785
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:44,100
That will depend on the manner
of your return.

786
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,700
What are you up to?

787
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,200
Sneaking off, are we?

788
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,700
Sneaking?

789
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,900
Sneaking?

790
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:21,500
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

791
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:26,600
Sméagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

792
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,100
...and they say "sneak."

793
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,200
Sneak?

794
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:35,600
Very nice friend.
Oh, yes, my precious.

795
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:38,400
-Very nice, very nice.
-All right. All right!

796
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,900
You just startled me is all.

797
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,300
What were you doing?

798
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Sneaking.

799
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:51,400
Fine. Have it your own way.

800
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:56,200
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

801
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,500
We have to be moving on.

802
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,300
It's dark still.

803
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,700
It's always dark here.

804
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,900
It's gone!

805
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:17,900
-The Elven bread.
-What?

806
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:19,600
That's all we have left.

807
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:26,100
He took it. He must have!

808
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,900
Sméagol?
No, no, not poor Sméagol.

809
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,900
Sméagol hates nasty Elf bread.

810
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:36,200
You're a lying rat!
What did you do with it?!

811
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,100
He doesn't eat it.

812
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,400
-He can't have taken it.
-Look.

813
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,200
What's this?

814
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,200
Crumbs on his jacketses.
He took it!

815
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:52,700
He took it.

816
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:57,600
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

817
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:59,600
That's a filthy lie!

818
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:02,000
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

819
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,400
-Sam!
-Call me--

820
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:04,900
Stop it!

821
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,100
Sam!

822
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:11,900
-I'll kill him!
-Sam! No!

823
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:18,500
Oh, my-- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so-- So angry.

824
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,900
Here, just--
Let's just rest a bit.

825
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:23,100
-I'm all right.
-No.

826
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:26,300
No, you're not all right.
You're exhausted.

827
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,600
It's that Gollum.

828
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:30,500
It's this place.

829
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,300
It's that thing around your neck.

830
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:38,100
I could help a bit.

831
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,900
I could carry it for a while.

832
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,800
Carry it for a while.

833
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:44,300
I could carry it... I could carry it.

834
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:50,200
Share the load...Share the load...
the load...the load.

835
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:51,800
Get away!

836
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,500
I don't want to keep it.

837
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,100
I just want to help.

838
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,700
See? See?

839
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,200
He wants it for himself.

840
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,200
Shut up, you!

841
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:11,600
Go away!
Get out of here!

842
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:13,600
No, Sam.

843
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,000
It's you.

844
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:21,000
I'm sorry, Sam.

845
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,000
But he's a liar.

846
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:26,800
He's poisoned you against me.

847
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:30,100
You can't help me anymore.

848
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,000
You don't mean that.

849
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:38,300
Go home.

850
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,100
Faramir!

851
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,200
Faramir!

852
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:05,700
Your father's will has turned
to madness.

853
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Do not throw away your life
so rashly.

854
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:12,000
Where does my allegiance lie
if not here?

855
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:15,500
This is the city of the Men of Númenor.

856
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:19,000
I will gladly give my life
to defend her beauty...

857
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:22,300
...her memory, her wisdom.

858
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:28,100
Your father loves you, Faramir.

859
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,900
He will remember it
before the end.

860
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:43,000
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

861
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:47,500
Well...

862
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:49,700
...yes.

863
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:54,100
At least, well enough
for my own people.

864
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:58,100
But we have no songs
for great halls...

865
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:00,500
...and evil times.

866
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:04,500
And why should your songs
be unfit for my halls?

867
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:08,700
Come, sing me a song.

868
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:23,000
Home is behind

869
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:26,900
The world ahead

870
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:35,100
And there are many paths to tread

871
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:40,500
Through shadow

872
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:44,900
To the edge of night

873
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:51,600
Until the stars are all alight

874
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:58,900
Mist and shadow

875
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:03,400
Cloud and shade

876
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,200
All shall fade

877
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:15,500
All shall

878
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:23,700
Fade

879
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:51,500
March! March!

880
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:56,900
March! March! March!

881
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:02,700
Make way for the king.

882
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,300
Make way.

883
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:10,800
The king is here.

884
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,300
My lord.

885
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:17,500
Hail to you, sire.

886
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:19,200
Grimbold, how many?

887
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,800
I bring 500 men from the Westfold,
my lord.

888
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:25,400
We have 300 more from Fenmarch,
Théoden King.

889
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:30,500
-Where are the riders from Snowbourn?
-None have come, my lord.

890
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:49,700
Six thousand spears.

891
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:52,800
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

892
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:56,400
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.

893
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:01,000
More will come.

894
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:04,300
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.

895
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:07,000
We have till dawn,
then we must ride.

896
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:28,800
The horses are restless...

897
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:30,500
...and the men are quiet.

898
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:34,100
They grow nervous in the shadow
of the mountain.

899
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:38,400
That road there...

900
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,500
...where does that lead?

901
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:46,000
It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

902
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:49,800
None who venture there ever return.

903
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,800
That mountain is evil.

904
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:17,600
Aragorn.

905
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:20,300
Let's find some food.

906
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:38,200
There.

907
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:42,100
A true esquire of Rohan.

908
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:47,800
I'm ready.

909
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:50,700
Sorry.

910
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:53,100
It isn't all that dangerous.

911
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:55,900
It's not even sharp.

912
01:36:56,700 --> 01:36:59,900
Well, that's no good. You won't kill
many Orcs with a blunt blade.

913
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:01,700
Come on.

914
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:08,300
To the smithy. Go!

915
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:12,400
You should not encourage him.

916
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:15,000
You should not doubt him.

917
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:18,400
I do not doubt his heart,
only the reach of his arm.

918
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:22,700
Why should Merry be left behind?

919
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,500
He has as much cause
to go to war as you.

920
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:30,800
Why can he not fight
for those he loves?

921
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:37,100
You know as little of war
as that Hobbit.

922
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:40,400
When the fear takes him...

923
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:45,500
...and the blood and the screams
and the horror of battle take hold...

924
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:48,200
...do you think he would stand and fight?

925
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,400
He would flee.

926
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:54,600
And he would be right to do so.

927
01:37:56,900 --> 01:38:00,700
War is the province of Men, Éowyn.

928
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:40,100
I choose a mortal life.

929
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:45,900
I wish I could've seen him...

930
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:49,700
...one last time.

931
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,400
Sir?

932
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:06,700
King Théoden awaits you, my lord.

933
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:29,500
I take my leave.

934
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:45,500
My lord Elrond.

935
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,400
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

936
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:54,600
Arwen is dying.

937
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:03,300
She will not long survive the evil
that now spreads from Mordor.

938
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:07,500
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

939
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:11,600
As Sauron's power grows,
her strength wanes.

940
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,600
Arwen's life is now tied
to the fate of the Ring.

941
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:19,000
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

942
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:21,000
The end has come.

943
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:24,000
It will not be our end, but his.

944
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:28,300
You ride to war, but not to victory.

945
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:32,900
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith,
this you know.

946
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:37,500
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

947
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:41,500
A fleet of Corsair ships sails
from the south.

948
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:44,200
They'll be in the city in two days.

949
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:47,500
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

950
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,400
You need more men.

951
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:52,500
There are none.

952
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:58,100
There are those who dwell
in the mountain.

953
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:09,400
Murderers...

954
01:41:09,700 --> 01:41:11,000
...traitors.

955
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:15,500
You would call upon them to fight?

956
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:17,300
They believe in nothing.

957
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:19,600
They answer to no one.

958
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:22,800
They will answer
to the king of Gondor.

959
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:35,000
Andúril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

960
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:53,800
Sauron will not have forgotten
the Sword of Elendil.

961
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,500
The blade that was broken
shall return to Minas Tirith.

962
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:15,200
The man who can wield
the power of this sword...

963
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:19,300
...can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

964
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:23,300
Put aside the Ranger.

965
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:26,800
Become who you were born to be.

966
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,900
Take the Dimholt road.

967
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:35,800
I give hope to Men.

968
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:43,000
I keep none for myself.

969
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:56,700
Why are you doing this?

970
01:42:57,300 --> 01:43:00,300
The war lies to the east.
You cannot leave on the eve of battle.

971
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:04,800
You cannot abandon the men.

972
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:07,700
Éowyn....

973
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,100
We need you here.

974
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:13,100
Why have you come?

975
01:43:14,900 --> 01:43:16,700
Do you not know?

976
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:28,900
It is but a shadow and a thought
that you love.

977
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,300
I cannot give you what you seek.

978
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,700
I have wished you joy
since first I saw you.

979
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,200
Just where do you think
you're off to?

980
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:15,700
Not this time.

981
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,100
This time you must stay, Gimli.

982
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:23,600
Have you learned nothing
of the stubbornness of Dwarves?

983
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:27,400
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

984
01:44:49,900 --> 01:44:52,000
-What's happening?
-Where is he going?

985
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,200
Where's he going?

986
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:58,800
I don't understand.

987
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:05,000
Lord Aragorn!

988
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:08,100
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

989
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:11,500
He leaves because there is no hope.

990
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:14,300
He leaves because he must.

991
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:16,200
Too few have come.

992
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:18,400
We cannot defeat
the armies of Mordor.

993
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,600
No...

994
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:24,300
...we cannot.

995
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:30,900
But we will meet them
in battle nonetheless.

996
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:47,100
I have left instruction.

997
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:53,000
The people are to follow
your rule in my stead.

998
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:01,900
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

999
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:06,000
Long may you defend Edoras...

1000
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:08,500
... if the battle goes ill.

1001
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:12,900
What other duty would you
have me do, my lord?

1002
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:17,200
Duty?

1003
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:20,700
No.

1004
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:31,100
I would have you smile again...

1005
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:39,400
...not grieve for those
whose time has come.

1006
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:47,800
You shall live to see
these days renewed...

1007
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:55,000
...and no more despair.

1008
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:04,800
What kind of army would linger
in such a place?

1009
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:06,900
One that is cursed.

1010
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:11,300
Long ago, the Men of the Mountains
swore an oath...

1011
01:47:11,900 --> 01:47:14,600
...to the last king of Gondor...

1012
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:16,700
...to come to his aid...

1013
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,600
...to fight.

1014
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:21,300
But when the time came...

1015
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,500
...when Gondor's need was dire...

1016
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,600
...they fled...

1017
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:30,100
...vanishing into the darkness
of the mountain.

1018
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:33,500
And so lsildur cursed them...

1019
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:38,800
...never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge.

1020
01:47:43,300 --> 01:47:46,300
Who shall call them
from the grey twilight?

1021
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:49,100
The forgotten people.

1022
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:51,700
The heir of him to whom
the oath they swore.

1023
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:54,100
From the north shall he come.

1024
01:47:54,700 --> 01:47:56,300
Need shall drive him.

1025
01:47:57,400 --> 01:48:00,800
He shall pass the door
to the Paths of the Dead.

1026
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:22,500
The very warmth of my blood
seems stolen away.

1027
01:48:28,300 --> 01:48:30,100
The way is shut.

1028
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,800
It was made by those
who are dead.

1029
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:35,700
And the Dead keep it.

1030
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:37,800
The way is shut.

1031
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:50,600
Brego!

1032
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:56,800
I do not fear death.

1033
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:11,600
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

1034
01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:16,300
An Elf will go underground
where a Dwarf dare not?

1035
01:49:16,700 --> 01:49:18,000
Oh.

1036
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:20,900
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

1037
01:49:36,100 --> 01:49:38,200
We must ride light and swift.

1038
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:40,200
It is a long road ahead.

1039
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:43,300
And man and beast must reach the end
with the strength to fight.

1040
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,800
Little Hobbits do not belong in war,
Master Meriadoc.

1041
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:54,200
All my friends have gone to battle.

1042
01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:56,200
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

1043
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:58,500
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

1044
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:01,100
And none of my riders can bear you
as a burden.

1045
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:04,200
I want to fight.

1046
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,700
I will say no more.

1047
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:25,500
Ride with me.

1048
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,300
My lady.

1049
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:30,900
Form up! Move out!

1050
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:34,200
Form up! Move out!

1051
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:38,600
Ride!

1052
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:41,600
Ride now to Gondor!

1053
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:25,000
What is it?

1054
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:26,800
What do you see?

1055
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:29,200
I see shapes of men.

1056
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:33,200
And of horses.

1057
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:35,200
Where?

1058
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:38,200
Pale banners like shreds of cloud.

1059
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:43,000
Spears rise...

1060
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:47,000
... Iike winter-thickets
through a shroud of mist.

1061
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:50,500
The Dead are following.

1062
01:51:51,700 --> 01:51:53,200
They have been summoned.

1063
01:51:53,900 --> 01:51:55,700
The Dead?

1064
01:51:56,100 --> 01:51:57,800
Summoned?

1065
01:51:58,300 --> 01:52:00,100
I knew that.

1066
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:05,100
Very good.

1067
01:52:05,900 --> 01:52:07,900
Very good! Legolas!

1068
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:47,300
Do not look down.

1069
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:44,800
Who enters my domain?

1070
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:51,000
One who will have your allegiance.

1071
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:59,100
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

1072
01:53:59,700 --> 01:54:02,200
You will suffer me.

1073
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:29,100
The way is shut.

1074
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:34,700
It was made by those who are dead.

1075
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:39,300
And the Dead keep it.

1076
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:51,500
The way is shut.

1077
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:55,900
Now you must die.

1078
01:54:59,900 --> 01:55:02,600
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

1079
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:07,800
None but the king of Gondor
may command me.

1080
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:15,700
That line was broken.

1081
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:20,500
It has been remade.

1082
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:30,100
Fight for us...

1083
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:32,700
...and regain your honour.

1084
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,200
What say you?

1085
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:52,000
What say you?

1086
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:54,600
You waste your time, Aragorn.

1087
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:57,800
They had no honour in life,
they have none now in death.

1088
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:00,900
I am lsildur's heir.

1089
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:03,400
Fight for me...

1090
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:07,500
...and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

1091
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:13,400
What say you?

1092
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:23,500
You have my word!

1093
01:56:23,900 --> 01:56:27,700
Fight, and I will release you
from this living death!

1094
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:30,900
What say you?!

1095
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:37,000
Stand, you traitors!

1096
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:05,100
Out!

1097
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:28,000
Legolas!

1098
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:30,400
Run!

1099
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:38,800
We fight.

1100
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:51,700
Open the gate! Quick!

1101
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:24,600
Quick! Hurry!

1102
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:40,100
Faramir!

1103
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:44,300
Say not that he has fallen.

1104
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:47,100
They were outnumbered.

1105
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:49,000
None survived.

1106
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:51,700
Fear.

1107
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:55,400
The city is rank with it.

1108
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,300
Let us ease their pain.

1109
02:00:00,700 --> 02:00:02,300
Release the prisoners.

1110
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:04,500
Catapults!

1111
02:00:17,900 --> 02:00:21,200
My sons are spent.

1112
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:25,200
My line has ended.

1113
02:00:28,100 --> 02:00:29,500
He's alive!

1114
02:00:29,700 --> 02:00:32,800
The House of Stewards has failed.

1115
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,400
He needs medicine, my lord.

1116
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:38,100
My line has ended!

1117
02:00:39,700 --> 02:00:41,600
My lord!

1118
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:57,000
Rohan...

1119
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:00,100
...has deserted us.

1120
02:01:14,700 --> 02:01:17,700
Théoden's betrayed me.

1121
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,800
Abandon your posts!

1122
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:35,600
Flee! Flee for your lives!

1123
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,400
Prepare for battle!

1124
02:01:48,100 --> 02:01:51,100
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

1125
02:01:52,300 --> 02:01:54,200
Over here!

1126
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:57,400
Return to your posts!

1127
02:02:08,300 --> 02:02:10,800
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

1128
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:22,400
Stay where you are.

1129
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:40,900
We need more rubble!

1130
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,800
Watch out!

1131
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:45,500
Down to the lower levels. Quick!

1132
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:49,000
Double up, men!

1133
02:03:58,100 --> 02:04:00,900
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

1134
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:04,900
Stand to your posts! Fight!

1135
02:04:45,700 --> 02:04:47,200
Not at the towers!

1136
02:04:47,500 --> 02:04:50,400
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

1137
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:53,100
Bring them down!

1138
02:05:28,300 --> 02:05:30,200
Fight them back!

1139
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:32,400
Peregrin Took!

1140
02:05:33,300 --> 02:05:36,400
-Go back to the Citadel!
-They'd called us out to fight.

1141
02:05:52,100 --> 02:05:54,400
This is no place for a Hobbit.

1142
02:06:20,300 --> 02:06:21,700
Guard of the Citadel, indeed.

1143
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:25,600
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

1144
02:06:37,100 --> 02:06:39,900
What are you doing,
you useless scum?!

1145
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:42,000
The door won't give. It's too strong.

1146
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:50,800
Get back there and smash it down.

1147
02:06:51,100 --> 02:06:53,000
But nothing can breach it.

1148
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,200
Grond will breach it.

1149
02:07:01,700 --> 02:07:03,600
Bring up the wolf's head.

1150
02:07:06,900 --> 02:07:12,000
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

1151
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:16,200
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1152
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:21,600
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1153
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:25,900
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1154
02:07:26,500 --> 02:07:30,500
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1155
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:34,400
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1156
02:07:56,500 --> 02:07:58,200
You may go no further.

1157
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:04,300
You will not enter Gondor.

1158
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:07,000
Who are you to deny us passage?

1159
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:10,900
Legolas, fire a warning shot
past the bosun's ear.

1160
02:08:13,300 --> 02:08:14,900
Mind your aim.

1161
02:08:21,700 --> 02:08:24,000
That's it. Right. We warned you.

1162
02:08:24,300 --> 02:08:26,400
Prepare to be boarded.

1163
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:29,000
Boarded?

1164
02:08:29,300 --> 02:08:30,800
By you and whose army?

1165
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:34,600
This army.

1166
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:53,200
In there.

1167
02:08:54,900 --> 02:08:56,700
What is this place?

1168
02:09:01,200 --> 02:09:04,500
Master must go inside the tunnel.

1169
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:09,800
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

1170
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,200
It's the only way.

1171
02:09:16,700 --> 02:09:18,600
Go in...

1172
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:21,300
...or go back.

1173
02:09:24,100 --> 02:09:26,800
I can't go back.

1174
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:41,600
-What's that smell?
-Orcses' filth.

1175
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:45,100
Orcses come in here sometimes.

1176
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:52,000
Hurry.

1177
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,800
This way.

1178
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:03,500
Sméagol?

1179
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:06,600
Over here.

1180
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:18,000
It's sticky. What is it?

1181
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:20,500
You'll see.

1182
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:23,000
Oh, yes.

1183
02:10:23,300 --> 02:10:26,300
You will see.

1184
02:10:35,300 --> 02:10:36,900
Sméagol?

1185
02:10:38,300 --> 02:10:39,500
Sméagol!

1186
02:10:42,300 --> 02:10:44,100
Sméagol!

1187
02:10:53,500 --> 02:10:55,300
Sam.

1188
02:12:35,500 --> 02:12:37,500
And you, Frodo Baggins...

1189
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:43,000
...I give you the light of Earendil,
our most beloved star.

1190
02:12:43,900 --> 02:12:47,100
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

1191
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:51,100
...when all other lights go out.

1192
02:14:07,300 --> 02:14:10,400
Naughty little fly

1193
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:13,800
Why does he cry?

1194
02:14:14,500 --> 02:14:17,700
Caught in a web

1195
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,700
Soon you'll be....

1196
02:14:21,100 --> 02:14:22,900
Eaten.

1197
02:15:00,100 --> 02:15:02,700
Got away, did it, precious?

1198
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Not this time.

1199
02:15:05,300 --> 02:15:08,200
-Not this time!
-No!

1200
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:18,400
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

1201
02:15:19,100 --> 02:15:21,600
Sméagol wouldn't hurt master.

1202
02:15:21,800 --> 02:15:23,700
We promised.

1203
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:26,200
You must believe us.

1204
02:15:26,600 --> 02:15:28,200
It was the precious.

1205
02:15:28,400 --> 02:15:33,000
The precious made us do it.

1206
02:15:50,300 --> 02:15:53,100
I have to destroy it, Sméagol.

1207
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:05,400
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.

1208
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:17,100
No!

1209
02:16:40,400 --> 02:16:42,700
I'm so sorry, Sam.

1210
02:16:47,300 --> 02:16:49,700
I'm so sorry.

1211
02:17:15,500 --> 02:17:20,100
This task was appointed to you,
Frodo of the Shire.

1212
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:23,800
Ifyou do not find a way...

1213
02:17:25,200 --> 02:17:26,300
...no one will.

1214
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:02,800
The scouts report
Minas Tirith is surrounded.

1215
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:05,400
The lower level's in flames.

1216
02:18:05,900 --> 02:18:08,300
Everywhere,
legions of the enemy advance.

1217
02:18:08,600 --> 02:18:09,700
Time is against us.

1218
02:18:10,400 --> 02:18:11,600
Make ready!

1219
02:18:11,800 --> 02:18:13,600
Take heart, Merry.

1220
02:18:13,800 --> 02:18:15,900
It will soon be over.

1221
02:18:16,600 --> 02:18:18,100
My lady...

1222
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:21,300
...you are fair and brave...

1223
02:18:21,700 --> 02:18:24,000
...and have much to live for...

1224
02:18:25,500 --> 02:18:27,800
...and many who love you.

1225
02:18:30,700 --> 02:18:33,300
I know it is too late to turn aside.

1226
02:18:33,900 --> 02:18:37,000
I know there is not much point
now in hoping.

1227
02:18:38,400 --> 02:18:41,600
If I were a knight of Rohan,
capable of great deeds....

1228
02:18:41,900 --> 02:18:44,900
But I'm not.

1229
02:18:45,300 --> 02:18:47,000
I'm a Hobbit.

1230
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:52,200
And I know I can't save Middle-earth.

1231
02:18:55,700 --> 02:18:57,900
I just want to help my friends.

1232
02:19:00,100 --> 02:19:01,500
Frodo.

1233
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:04,100
Sam.

1234
02:19:05,700 --> 02:19:07,700
Pippin.

1235
02:19:09,300 --> 02:19:12,200
More than anything,
I wish I could see them again.

1236
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:18,800
Prepare to move out!

1237
02:19:19,100 --> 02:19:21,700
Make haste.
We ride through the night.

1238
02:19:38,500 --> 02:19:39,800
To battle.

1239
02:19:40,200 --> 02:19:41,600
To battle.

1240
02:20:04,700 --> 02:20:06,400
Back to the gate!

1241
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:08,900
Hurry!

1242
02:20:28,900 --> 02:20:33,200
I am steward of the House of Anárion.

1243
02:20:33,500 --> 02:20:35,800
Thus have I walked.

1244
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:40,100
And thus now will I sleep.

1245
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:48,300
Gondor is lost.

1246
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:52,100
There is no hope for Men.

1247
02:21:06,900 --> 02:21:09,600
Why do the fools fly?

1248
02:21:11,300 --> 02:21:14,300
Better to die sooner than late.

1249
02:21:16,500 --> 02:21:18,500
For die we must.

1250
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:33,700
No tomb for Denethor
and Faramir.

1251
02:21:34,900 --> 02:21:40,600
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

1252
02:21:41,100 --> 02:21:46,000
We shall burn,
like the heathen kings of old.

1253
02:21:49,900 --> 02:21:51,600
Bring wood and oil.

1254
02:21:54,500 --> 02:21:55,800
Steady.

1255
02:21:56,100 --> 02:21:58,000
Steady.

1256
02:22:12,600 --> 02:22:15,000
You are soldiers of Gondor.

1257
02:22:15,300 --> 02:22:19,600
No matter what comes through that gate,
you will stand your ground.

1258
02:22:26,200 --> 02:22:27,300
Run!

1259
02:22:29,300 --> 02:22:30,700
Volley!

1260
02:22:31,500 --> 02:22:33,300
Fire!

1261
02:24:26,600 --> 02:24:28,500
Let him go, you filth.

1262
02:24:30,600 --> 02:24:32,100
Let him go!

1263
02:24:33,500 --> 02:24:35,500
You will not touch him again.

1264
02:24:38,700 --> 02:24:40,500
Come on and finish it.

1265
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:31,900
Back!

1266
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:44,000
Mr. Frodo.

1267
02:26:53,700 --> 02:26:55,600
Oh, no.

1268
02:26:55,800 --> 02:26:57,600
Frodo.

1269
02:26:58,000 --> 02:26:59,800
Mr. Frodo.

1270
02:27:04,500 --> 02:27:05,800
Wake up.

1271
02:27:09,700 --> 02:27:12,000
Don't leave me here alone.

1272
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:16,000
Don't go where I can't follow.

1273
02:27:20,300 --> 02:27:21,600
Wake up.

1274
02:27:28,400 --> 02:27:30,500
Not asleep.

1275
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:34,600
Dead.

1276
02:27:53,400 --> 02:27:54,800
You get back, you scum!

1277
02:28:04,600 --> 02:28:05,800
What's this?

1278
02:28:07,100 --> 02:28:09,700
Looks like old Shelob's
been having a bit of fun.

1279
02:28:11,700 --> 02:28:14,100
Killed another one, has she?

1280
02:28:14,500 --> 02:28:16,400
No.

1281
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:21,100
This fellow ain't dead.

1282
02:28:21,400 --> 02:28:23,600
Not dead?

1283
02:28:23,900 --> 02:28:29,400
She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

1284
02:28:30,100 --> 02:28:32,700
Then she has her way with them.

1285
02:28:33,100 --> 02:28:34,800
That's how she likes to feed.

1286
02:28:35,400 --> 02:28:37,400
Fresh blood.

1287
02:28:37,700 --> 02:28:39,900
Get him to the tower!

1288
02:28:43,400 --> 02:28:45,000
Samwise, you fool.

1289
02:28:45,300 --> 02:28:48,000
This scum will be awake
in a couple of hours.

1290
02:28:48,300 --> 02:28:50,700
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

1291
02:29:15,100 --> 02:29:18,200
The house of his spirit crumbles.

1292
02:29:19,400 --> 02:29:20,800
He is burning.

1293
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:23,200
Already burning.

1294
02:29:23,700 --> 02:29:25,600
He's not dead.

1295
02:29:26,200 --> 02:29:27,800
He's not dead!

1296
02:29:30,100 --> 02:29:31,800
No! No!

1297
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,200
No! No!

1298
02:29:34,500 --> 02:29:36,400
He's not dead!

1299
02:29:36,900 --> 02:29:40,200
-Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
-No! No! No!

1300
02:29:40,500 --> 02:29:43,700
I release you from my service.

1301
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:49,400
Go now and die in what way
seems best to you.

1302
02:29:51,700 --> 02:29:53,900
Pour oil on the wood!

1303
02:29:55,700 --> 02:29:57,700
Come on, soldier! Move it!

1304
02:29:58,300 --> 02:30:01,100
-Hurry along there! Hurry along!
-Gandalf!

1305
02:30:01,500 --> 02:30:02,900
Where is Gandalf?

1306
02:30:04,100 --> 02:30:05,400
Gandalf!

1307
02:30:10,900 --> 02:30:12,000
Retreat!

1308
02:30:14,300 --> 02:30:15,900
The city is breached!

1309
02:30:16,100 --> 02:30:18,900
Fall back to the second level!

1310
02:30:22,900 --> 02:30:24,400
Get the women and children out!

1311
02:30:24,900 --> 02:30:26,500
Get them out!

1312
02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:28,200
Retreat!

1313
02:30:28,400 --> 02:30:30,100
Come on. Come on.

1314
02:30:30,500 --> 02:30:34,600
Move into the city. Kill all in your path.

1315
02:30:42,800 --> 02:30:45,100
Take them down!

1316
02:31:05,800 --> 02:31:08,500
Fight. Fight to the last man!

1317
02:31:08,800 --> 02:31:10,000
Fight for your lives!

1318
02:31:10,200 --> 02:31:11,400
Gandalf!

1319
02:31:15,900 --> 02:31:17,200
Gandalf!

1320
02:31:17,400 --> 02:31:19,900
Denethor has lost his mind!

1321
02:31:20,200 --> 02:31:22,400
He's burning Faramir alive!

1322
02:31:22,700 --> 02:31:24,400
Up! Quickly!

1323
02:31:31,300 --> 02:31:32,700
Go back to the abyss.

1324
02:31:34,300 --> 02:31:37,300
Fall into the nothingness
that awaits you and your master.

1325
02:31:37,700 --> 02:31:43,900
Do you not know death when you see it,
old man?

1326
02:31:44,300 --> 02:31:48,700
This is my hour.

1327
02:31:58,500 --> 02:32:00,000
Gandalf!

1328
02:32:08,900 --> 02:32:12,300
You have failed.

1329
02:32:13,300 --> 02:32:17,900
The world of Men will fall.

1330
02:33:15,500 --> 02:33:16,800
Courage, Merry.

1331
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,300
Courage for our friends.

1332
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,900
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

1333
02:33:26,200 --> 02:33:29,300
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

1334
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:40,600
Éomer, take your éored
down the left flank.

1335
02:33:40,900 --> 02:33:42,100
Flank ready.

1336
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:45,100
Gamling, follow the king's banner
down the center.

1337
02:33:45,400 --> 02:33:48,900
Grimbold, take your company right
after you pass the wall.

1338
02:33:49,300 --> 02:33:51,900
Forth, and fear no darkness!

1339
02:33:52,200 --> 02:33:55,900
Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!

1340
02:33:56,200 --> 02:34:01,200
Spears shall be shaken,
shields shall be splintered...

1341
02:34:01,700 --> 02:34:05,200
...a sword-day, a red day...

1342
02:34:05,500 --> 02:34:08,900
...ere the sun rises!

1343
02:34:16,900 --> 02:34:21,000
Whatever happens, stay with me.
I'll look after you.

1344
02:34:27,500 --> 02:34:29,500
Ride now!

1345
02:34:31,200 --> 02:34:33,200
Ride now!

1346
02:34:33,900 --> 02:34:36,500
Ride! Ride for ruin...

1347
02:34:36,800 --> 02:34:39,400
...and the world's ending!

1348
02:34:41,500 --> 02:34:42,800
Death!

1349
02:34:43,300 --> 02:34:46,100
Death!

1350
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:49,500
-Death!
-Death!

1351
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:51,500
-Death!
-Death!

1352
02:34:52,300 --> 02:34:55,600
-Death!
-Death!

1353
02:35:00,900 --> 02:35:03,200
Forth Eorlingas!

1354
02:35:46,200 --> 02:35:47,900
Fire!

1355
02:35:51,900 --> 02:35:53,000
Death!

1356
02:35:57,300 --> 02:35:58,500
Charge!

1357
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:00,500
Fire at will!

1358
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:01,100
Set a fire in our flesh.

1359
02:37:18,800 --> 02:37:20,500
Stay this madness!

1360
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:29,400
You may triumph in the field of battle
for a day...

1361
02:37:30,100 --> 02:37:33,600
...but against the power that has risen
in the east...

1362
02:37:33,800 --> 02:37:36,900
...there is no victory.

1363
02:38:06,400 --> 02:38:08,000
No!

1364
02:38:08,200 --> 02:38:10,800
You will not take my son from me!

1365
02:38:11,100 --> 02:38:13,300
No! No!

1366
02:38:24,300 --> 02:38:25,900
Faramir.

1367
02:38:39,500 --> 02:38:43,300
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

1368
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:12,700
Drive them to the river!

1369
02:39:15,600 --> 02:39:17,500
Make safe the city!

1370
02:39:57,600 --> 02:39:59,400
Re-form the line!

1371
02:40:00,600 --> 02:40:02,500
Re-form the line!

1372
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:12,100
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!

1373
02:40:12,900 --> 02:40:14,900
Charge!

1374
02:41:34,100 --> 02:41:35,400
Cut him down!

1375
02:42:02,100 --> 02:42:04,600
Take the reins. Pull him left!

1376
02:42:07,100 --> 02:42:08,300
Left!

1377
02:42:25,800 --> 02:42:27,400
Aim for their heads!

1378
02:42:33,500 --> 02:42:36,600
Bring it down! Bring it down!
Bring it down!

1379
02:42:50,600 --> 02:42:52,000
Merry!

1380
02:44:05,500 --> 02:44:07,500
I didn't think it would end this way.

1381
02:44:08,800 --> 02:44:10,200
End?

1382
02:44:11,500 --> 02:44:13,500
No, the journey doesn't end here.

1383
02:44:16,100 --> 02:44:19,100
Death is just another path...

1384
02:44:19,800 --> 02:44:21,400
...one that we all must take.

1385
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:26,100
The grey rain curtain
of this world rolls back...

1386
02:44:26,400 --> 02:44:29,800
...and all turns to silver glass.

1387
02:44:32,100 --> 02:44:34,000
And then you see it.

1388
02:44:36,100 --> 02:44:38,300
What, Gandalf?

1389
02:44:39,500 --> 02:44:40,800
See what?

1390
02:44:42,200 --> 02:44:44,300
White shores...

1391
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,300
...and beyond.

1392
02:44:49,900 --> 02:44:51,600
A far green country...

1393
02:44:52,400 --> 02:44:55,200
...under a swift sunrise.

1394
02:44:59,400 --> 02:45:00,800
Well...

1395
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:02,600
...that isn't so bad.

1396
02:45:02,900 --> 02:45:04,200
No.

1397
02:45:06,300 --> 02:45:07,900
No, it isn't.

1398
02:45:24,400 --> 02:45:27,600
Rally to me! To me!

1399
02:45:48,500 --> 02:45:52,900
Feast on his flesh.

1400
02:45:57,400 --> 02:45:59,600
I will kill you if you touch him.

1401
02:45:59,900 --> 02:46:05,100
Do not come between
the Nazgûl and his prey.

1402
02:47:14,500 --> 02:47:17,600
Late as usual, pirate scum!

1403
02:47:18,100 --> 02:47:20,200
There's knife-work here needs doing.

1404
02:47:20,500 --> 02:47:23,600
Come on, you sea rats!
Get off your ships!

1405
02:47:39,200 --> 02:47:41,200
There's plenty for the both of us.

1406
02:47:41,500 --> 02:47:43,500
May the best Dwarf win.

1407
02:48:01,100 --> 02:48:03,200
You fool.

1408
02:48:03,500 --> 02:48:06,700
No man can kill me.

1409
02:48:09,200 --> 02:48:12,200
Die now.

1410
02:48:23,100 --> 02:48:25,000
I am no man.

1411
02:48:41,600 --> 02:48:44,900
-Fifteen! Sixteen!
-Seventeen!

1412
02:48:52,900 --> 02:48:54,700
Merry!

1413
02:49:36,800 --> 02:49:38,500
Legolas!

1414
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,300
Thirty-three, thirty-four.

1415
02:50:50,500 --> 02:50:52,700
That still only counts as one!

1416
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,100
Come on, then. Come on!

1417
02:51:38,900 --> 02:51:41,600
I know your face...

1418
02:51:43,600 --> 02:51:45,400
...Éowyn.

1419
02:51:48,100 --> 02:51:50,300
My eyes darken.

1420
02:51:51,500 --> 02:51:52,800
No.

1421
02:51:53,700 --> 02:51:55,300
No.

1422
02:51:57,500 --> 02:51:59,900
I am going to save you.

1423
02:52:01,300 --> 02:52:03,500
You already did.

1424
02:52:07,300 --> 02:52:08,900
Éowyn...

1425
02:52:10,400 --> 02:52:12,800
...my body is broken.

1426
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,300
You have to let me go.

1427
02:52:26,300 --> 02:52:28,700
I go to my fathers...

1428
02:52:30,400 --> 02:52:33,100
...in whose mighty company...

1429
02:52:33,600 --> 02:52:36,800
... I shall not nowfeel ashamed.

1430
02:52:53,500 --> 02:52:55,100
Éowyn.

1431
02:53:41,700 --> 02:53:44,000
Release us.

1432
02:53:46,100 --> 02:53:47,700
Bad idea.

1433
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:51,700
Very handy in a tight spot, these lads,
despite the fact they're dead.

1434
02:53:51,900 --> 02:53:53,800
You gave us your word.

1435
02:53:55,700 --> 02:53:57,800
I hold your oath fulfilled.

1436
02:53:59,200 --> 02:54:00,400
Go.

1437
02:54:01,400 --> 02:54:03,000
Be at peace.

1438
02:54:46,400 --> 02:54:48,300
Merry.

1439
02:54:48,900 --> 02:54:52,000
No!

1440
02:54:56,100 --> 02:54:58,400
No!

1441
02:55:22,200 --> 02:55:25,900
With a sigh

1442
02:55:26,300 --> 02:55:29,800
You turn away

1443
02:55:30,200 --> 02:55:34,000
With a deepening heart

1444
02:55:34,300 --> 02:55:38,800
No more words to say

1445
02:55:39,200 --> 02:55:42,600
You will find

1446
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:46,800
That the world has changed

1447
02:55:47,100 --> 02:55:51,100
Forever

1448
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:23,400
And the trees are now
Turning from green to gold

1449
02:56:27,700 --> 02:56:32,800
And the sun is now fading

1450
02:56:33,100 --> 02:56:39,500
I wish I could hold you

1451
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,500
Closer

1452
02:56:45,500 --> 02:56:46,700
Merry!

1453
02:56:48,400 --> 02:56:50,300
Merry!

1454
02:57:01,700 --> 02:57:03,500
Merry.

1455
02:57:06,100 --> 02:57:07,200
Merry, it's me.

1456
02:57:09,900 --> 02:57:11,300
It's Pippin.

1457
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,100
I knew you'd find me.

1458
02:57:16,400 --> 02:57:17,600
Yes.

1459
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,000
Are you going to leave me?

1460
02:57:22,700 --> 02:57:24,300
No, Merry.

1461
02:57:25,700 --> 02:57:27,800
I'm going to look after you.

1462
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:13,300
Hands off!

1463
02:58:13,500 --> 02:58:16,500
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

1464
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:20,900
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

1465
02:58:22,600 --> 02:58:26,300
I don't take orders from
stinking Morgul-rats!

1466
02:58:27,300 --> 02:58:32,300
You touch it, and I'll stick
this blade in your gut.

1467
02:58:53,200 --> 02:58:54,900
The scum tried to knife me.

1468
02:58:55,100 --> 02:58:56,800
Kill him!

1469
03:00:40,100 --> 03:00:42,000
That's for Frodo!

1470
03:00:42,500 --> 03:00:44,500
And for the Shire!

1471
03:00:48,200 --> 03:00:50,300
And that's for my old Gaffer!

1472
03:01:19,900 --> 03:01:23,000
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

1473
03:01:24,200 --> 03:01:28,700
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

1474
03:01:36,300 --> 03:01:37,900
Not if I stick you first.

1475
03:01:38,200 --> 03:01:39,600
Sam!

1476
03:01:44,800 --> 03:01:46,700
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

1477
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:48,900
Sorry for everything.

1478
03:01:49,500 --> 03:01:53,000
-Let's get you out of here.
-It's too late. It's over.

1479
03:01:53,300 --> 03:01:56,100
They've taken it. Sam...

1480
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:58,500
...they took the Ring.

1481
03:01:59,300 --> 03:02:01,900
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

1482
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:16,100
I thought I'd lost you.

1483
03:02:16,600 --> 03:02:18,200
So I took it.

1484
03:02:19,400 --> 03:02:21,400
Only for safekeeping.

1485
03:02:22,700 --> 03:02:24,400
Give it to me.

1486
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:30,100
Give me the Ring, Sam.

1487
03:02:34,900 --> 03:02:36,100
Sam.

1488
03:02:37,700 --> 03:02:39,600
Give me the Ring.

1489
03:03:00,500 --> 03:03:01,700
You must understand.

1490
03:03:05,300 --> 03:03:07,000
The Ring is my burden.

1491
03:03:08,300 --> 03:03:10,300
It will destroy you, Sam.

1492
03:03:13,600 --> 03:03:15,400
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1493
03:03:16,800 --> 03:03:18,400
We best find you some clothes.

1494
03:03:18,700 --> 03:03:21,600
You can't go walking through Mordor
in naught but your skin.

1495
03:03:43,400 --> 03:03:45,500
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

1496
03:03:46,100 --> 03:03:48,300
We made it to Mordor.

1497
03:03:49,800 --> 03:03:51,400
There are so many of them.

1498
03:03:52,400 --> 03:03:54,900
We'll never get through unseen.

1499
03:04:00,100 --> 03:04:03,300
It's him, the Eye.

1500
03:04:11,200 --> 03:04:13,700
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

1501
03:04:14,300 --> 03:04:16,200
There's nothing for it.

1502
03:04:19,300 --> 03:04:23,500
Come on. Let's just make it
down the hill for starters.

1503
03:04:33,100 --> 03:04:36,200
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

1504
03:04:37,600 --> 03:04:40,300
The darkness is deepening.

1505
03:04:40,700 --> 03:04:43,000
If Sauron had the Ring,
we would know it.

1506
03:04:43,200 --> 03:04:45,200
It's only a matter of time.

1507
03:04:46,700 --> 03:04:49,000
He has suffered a defeat, yes...

1508
03:04:50,300 --> 03:04:54,600
... but behind the walls of Mordor,
our enemy is regrouping.

1509
03:04:54,800 --> 03:04:56,600
Let him stay there.

1510
03:04:56,900 --> 03:04:59,400
Let him rot! Why should we care?

1511
03:04:59,700 --> 03:05:04,600
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

1512
03:05:11,600 --> 03:05:14,000
I've sent him to his death.

1513
03:05:15,700 --> 03:05:16,900
No.

1514
03:05:17,500 --> 03:05:19,800
There is still hope for Frodo.

1515
03:05:20,300 --> 03:05:24,200
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

1516
03:05:25,500 --> 03:05:27,900
-We can give him that.
-How?

1517
03:05:28,400 --> 03:05:30,900
Draw out Sauron's armies.

1518
03:05:31,200 --> 03:05:33,200
Empty his lands.

1519
03:05:33,600 --> 03:05:36,500
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

1520
03:05:37,300 --> 03:05:40,200
We cannot achieve victory
through strength of arms.

1521
03:05:40,500 --> 03:05:42,000
Not for ourselves.

1522
03:05:42,300 --> 03:05:47,600
But we can give Frodo his chance
if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

1523
03:05:49,700 --> 03:05:53,300
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

1524
03:05:54,200 --> 03:05:55,400
A diversion.

1525
03:05:55,500 --> 03:05:57,200
Certainty of death...

1526
03:05:57,500 --> 03:06:00,100
...small chance of success...

1527
03:06:01,200 --> 03:06:02,700
...what are we waiting for?

1528
03:06:03,300 --> 03:06:05,600
Sauron will suspect a trap.

1529
03:06:06,600 --> 03:06:08,500
He will not take the bait.

1530
03:06:10,100 --> 03:06:12,400
Oh, I think he will.

1531
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:49,500
Long have you hunted me.

1532
03:06:50,500 --> 03:06:51,700
Long have I eluded you.

1533
03:06:53,600 --> 03:06:55,100
No more.

1534
03:06:56,900 --> 03:06:59,200
Behold the Sword of Elendil.

1535
03:07:43,900 --> 03:07:46,300
The city has fallen silent.

1536
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:50,900
There is no warmth left in the sun.

1537
03:07:51,900 --> 03:07:53,500
It grows so cold.

1538
03:07:56,600 --> 03:07:59,500
It's just the damp
of the first spring rain.

1539
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:09,100
I do not believe this darkness
will endure.

1540
03:08:37,900 --> 03:08:39,300
Look, the Orcs...

1541
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:41,900
...they're moving off.

1542
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:45,000
You see, Mr. Frodo...

1543
03:08:45,300 --> 03:08:47,500
...some luck at last.

1544
03:08:47,800 --> 03:08:49,500
Move it, you slugs!

1545
03:08:50,900 --> 03:08:54,100
Come on! Faster!

1546
03:09:02,300 --> 03:09:05,400
Come along, you scum....

1547
03:09:05,700 --> 03:09:09,700
I'll whip you down to the bone, you....

1548
03:09:12,800 --> 03:09:14,300
Come on!

1549
03:09:14,600 --> 03:09:16,800
What have I told you?!

1550
03:09:23,700 --> 03:09:25,100
Get up!

1551
03:09:25,600 --> 03:09:28,200
Come on, you slugs!

1552
03:09:28,400 --> 03:09:31,900
You two are going straight
to the front line!

1553
03:09:32,300 --> 03:09:37,000
Now, move it! Go on!
Fall in! Move it!

1554
03:09:50,100 --> 03:09:53,800
To the Gate, you slugs!
Now, move it!

1555
03:10:03,400 --> 03:10:06,800
Don't you know we're at war?

1556
03:10:29,300 --> 03:10:32,000
Company, halt!

1557
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:39,200
Inspection!

1558
03:10:39,500 --> 03:10:41,800
Sam, help me.

1559
03:10:42,100 --> 03:10:43,900
Mr. Frodo!

1560
03:10:46,700 --> 03:10:49,100
Stand up, Mr. Frodo.
Stand up!

1561
03:10:49,400 --> 03:10:51,100
It's so heavy.

1562
03:11:00,400 --> 03:11:01,500
Oh, no.

1563
03:11:07,200 --> 03:11:09,100
What do I do?
What do we do?

1564
03:11:12,300 --> 03:11:13,400
-Hit me.
-What?

1565
03:11:13,500 --> 03:11:15,500
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.

1566
03:11:15,800 --> 03:11:17,300
Get off of me!

1567
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:20,200
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.

1568
03:11:29,000 --> 03:11:31,000
Get off of me!

1569
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:33,800
Break it up! Break it up!

1570
03:11:36,500 --> 03:11:40,800
Oi! I'll have your guts if you don't
shut this rabble down!

1571
03:11:41,200 --> 03:11:43,400
Go, Sam. Now!

1572
03:11:52,400 --> 03:11:53,900
Move along, scum!

1573
03:11:54,200 --> 03:11:56,000
Back in the line!

1574
03:11:56,600 --> 03:11:58,300
You maggots!

1575
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:01,900
Get back into the line,
you slugs!

1576
03:12:04,400 --> 03:12:07,700
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.

1577
03:12:10,700 --> 03:12:12,500
Move it!

1578
03:12:56,800 --> 03:12:58,700
I can't....

1579
03:12:58,900 --> 03:13:02,500
I can't....
I can't manage the Ring, Sam.

1580
03:13:02,900 --> 03:13:03,900
It's.... It's....

1581
03:13:04,200 --> 03:13:06,700
It's such a weight to carry.

1582
03:13:07,600 --> 03:13:08,600
It....

1583
03:13:08,800 --> 03:13:10,700
Such a weight.

1584
03:13:15,800 --> 03:13:18,100
We're going that way.
Straight as we can.

1585
03:13:19,700 --> 03:13:22,700
There's no point carrying anything
we're not sure to need.

1586
03:13:38,000 --> 03:13:39,700
Mr. Frodo.

1587
03:13:41,400 --> 03:13:42,800
Look.

1588
03:13:45,400 --> 03:13:47,100
There is light...

1589
03:13:47,600 --> 03:13:49,900
...and beauty up there...

1590
03:13:50,100 --> 03:13:51,800
...that no shadow can touch.

1591
03:14:42,900 --> 03:14:44,500
Take mine.

1592
03:14:45,100 --> 03:14:47,100
There's a few drops left.

1593
03:15:02,400 --> 03:15:04,900
There will be none left
for the return journey.

1594
03:15:05,900 --> 03:15:08,900
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

1595
03:16:01,900 --> 03:16:04,000
Frodo, get down!

1596
03:16:05,900 --> 03:16:07,700
Hide!

1597
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:19,900
Frodo!

1598
03:16:25,800 --> 03:16:27,200
Where are they?

1599
03:17:03,300 --> 03:17:06,200
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

1600
03:17:07,300 --> 03:17:10,000
Let justice be done upon him!

1601
03:17:53,600 --> 03:17:57,400
My master, Sauron the Great,
bids thee welcome.

1602
03:18:03,400 --> 03:18:07,000
Is there any in this rout
with authority to treat with me?

1603
03:18:07,500 --> 03:18:10,500
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

1604
03:18:10,800 --> 03:18:13,600
...faithless and accursed.

1605
03:18:13,900 --> 03:18:17,200
Tell your master this:
The armies of Mordor must disband.

1606
03:18:17,500 --> 03:18:20,100
He is to depart these lands,
never to return.

1607
03:18:21,200 --> 03:18:23,600
Old Greybeard.

1608
03:18:25,200 --> 03:18:29,300
I have a token I was bidden
to show thee.

1609
03:18:34,500 --> 03:18:35,800
Frodo.

1610
03:18:38,600 --> 03:18:40,000
Frodo.

1611
03:18:41,100 --> 03:18:42,200
-Silence.
-No!

1612
03:18:43,100 --> 03:18:44,400
Silence!

1613
03:18:46,200 --> 03:18:49,800
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.

1614
03:18:51,000 --> 03:18:54,900
Know that he suffered greatly
at the hands of his host.

1615
03:19:00,600 --> 03:19:06,100
Who would've thought one so small
could endure so much pain?

1616
03:19:09,000 --> 03:19:11,100
And he did, Gandalf.

1617
03:19:11,300 --> 03:19:13,000
He did.

1618
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:21,500
And who is this?

1619
03:19:21,700 --> 03:19:23,700
Isildur's heir?

1620
03:19:24,000 --> 03:19:26,900
It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.

1621
03:19:31,700 --> 03:19:34,200
I guess that concludes negotiations.

1622
03:19:36,500 --> 03:19:37,600
I do not believe it.

1623
03:19:39,600 --> 03:19:40,900
I will not.

1624
03:19:57,100 --> 03:19:58,800
Pull back.

1625
03:19:59,200 --> 03:20:01,100
Pull back!

1626
03:20:13,500 --> 03:20:15,400
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

1627
03:20:18,000 --> 03:20:20,900
The light's passed on,
away towards the north.

1628
03:20:21,200 --> 03:20:22,900
Something's drawn its gaze.

1629
03:20:40,500 --> 03:20:43,100
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

1630
03:20:45,300 --> 03:20:49,200
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

1631
03:20:52,200 --> 03:20:54,000
I see in your eyes...

1632
03:20:54,500 --> 03:20:58,400
...the same fear that would take
the heart of me.

1633
03:21:00,500 --> 03:21:04,200
A day may come
when the courage of Men fails...

1634
03:21:04,600 --> 03:21:07,700
...when we forsake our friends
and break all bonds of fellowship.

1635
03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:10,600
But it is not this day.

1636
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:13,900
An hour of wolves
and shattered shields...

1637
03:21:14,200 --> 03:21:17,000
...when the age of Men
comes crashing down.

1638
03:21:17,200 --> 03:21:19,600
But it is not this day.

1639
03:21:19,900 --> 03:21:21,400
This day we fight!

1640
03:21:24,000 --> 03:21:27,500
By all that you hold dear
on this good earth...

1641
03:21:27,900 --> 03:21:32,000
... I bid you stand, Men of the West!

1642
03:23:00,500 --> 03:23:03,900
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

1643
03:23:04,600 --> 03:23:06,800
What about side by side with a friend?

1644
03:23:10,500 --> 03:23:12,200
Aye.

1645
03:23:13,100 --> 03:23:14,800
I could do that.

1646
03:23:45,200 --> 03:23:47,200
Do you remember the Shire,
Mr. Frodo?

1647
03:23:50,200 --> 03:23:52,400
It'll be spring soon.

1648
03:23:53,200 --> 03:23:55,800
And the orchards will be in blossom.

1649
03:23:56,100 --> 03:23:59,600
And the birds will be nesting
in the hazel thicket.

1650
03:24:01,100 --> 03:24:05,000
And they'll be sowing
the summer barley in the lower fields...

1651
03:24:06,200 --> 03:24:10,400
...and eating the first
of the strawberries with cream.

1652
03:24:12,500 --> 03:24:14,900
Do you remember
the taste of strawberries?

1653
03:24:16,600 --> 03:24:18,300
No, Sam.

1654
03:24:18,400 --> 03:24:21,300
I can't recall the taste of food...

1655
03:24:22,600 --> 03:24:25,700
... nor the sound of water...

1656
03:24:26,000 --> 03:24:29,400
... nor the touch of grass.

1657
03:24:30,500 --> 03:24:32,000
I'm...

1658
03:24:33,000 --> 03:24:34,300
...naked in the dark.

1659
03:24:36,100 --> 03:24:38,300
There's-- There's nothing.

1660
03:24:38,400 --> 03:24:42,900
No veil between me
and the wheel of fire.

1661
03:24:44,500 --> 03:24:46,300
I can see him...

1662
03:24:46,800 --> 03:24:48,400
...with my waking eyes.

1663
03:24:49,500 --> 03:24:51,800
Then let us be rid of it...

1664
03:24:52,500 --> 03:24:54,700
...once and for all.

1665
03:24:55,500 --> 03:24:57,400
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1666
03:24:57,700 --> 03:25:00,200
I can't carry it for you...

1667
03:25:00,800 --> 03:25:02,800
...but I can carry you.

1668
03:25:03,400 --> 03:25:05,100
Come on!

1669
03:25:35,600 --> 03:25:38,400
Aragorn.

1670
03:25:50,100 --> 03:25:52,600
Elessar.

1671
03:26:04,700 --> 03:26:07,000
For Frodo.

1672
03:26:42,000 --> 03:26:43,400
Look, Mr. Frodo.

1673
03:26:44,200 --> 03:26:46,300
A doorway.

1674
03:26:47,000 --> 03:26:48,600
We're almost there.

1675
03:26:51,100 --> 03:26:54,800
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

1676
03:27:08,900 --> 03:27:10,500
Mustn't go that way.

1677
03:27:12,100 --> 03:27:14,400
Mustn't hurt the precious.

1678
03:27:14,700 --> 03:27:16,400
You swore!

1679
03:27:16,700 --> 03:27:18,600
You swore on the precious!

1680
03:27:20,700 --> 03:27:22,500
Sméagol promised!

1681
03:27:23,500 --> 03:27:25,400
Sméagol lied.

1682
03:28:18,000 --> 03:28:19,800
Frodo!

1683
03:28:47,000 --> 03:28:48,700
Eagles.

1684
03:28:50,100 --> 03:28:51,600
The eagles are coming!

1685
03:29:14,500 --> 03:29:16,200
Frodo!

1686
03:29:21,600 --> 03:29:22,800
I'm here, Sam.

1687
03:29:30,400 --> 03:29:31,900
Destroy it!

1688
03:29:42,600 --> 03:29:45,700
Go on! Now!

1689
03:29:46,000 --> 03:29:48,400
Throw it in the fire!

1690
03:30:02,000 --> 03:30:04,500
What are you waiting for?

1691
03:30:06,500 --> 03:30:08,800
Just let it go!

1692
03:30:42,100 --> 03:30:44,200
The Ring is mine.

1693
03:30:47,900 --> 03:30:49,600
No.

1694
03:30:50,000 --> 03:30:51,200
No.

1695
03:30:59,700 --> 03:31:02,300
No!

1696
03:32:46,800 --> 03:32:48,600
Yes!

1697
03:32:49,900 --> 03:32:51,500
Yes!

1698
03:32:52,800 --> 03:32:55,500
Precious! Precious!

1699
03:32:55,800 --> 03:32:58,800
Precious! Precious!

1700
03:33:51,900 --> 03:33:53,600
Give me your hand!

1701
03:34:02,100 --> 03:34:04,400
Take my hand!

1702
03:34:07,100 --> 03:34:08,400
No!

1703
03:34:15,800 --> 03:34:17,600
Don't you let go.

1704
03:34:22,300 --> 03:34:23,800
Don't let go.

1705
03:34:25,500 --> 03:34:26,900
Reach!

1706
03:35:56,200 --> 03:35:58,900
Frodo!

1707
03:35:59,600 --> 03:36:02,400
Frodo!

1708
03:37:24,000 --> 03:37:25,700
It's gone.

1709
03:37:30,200 --> 03:37:31,900
It's done.

1710
03:37:32,500 --> 03:37:34,400
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

1711
03:37:35,800 --> 03:37:38,100
It's over now.

1712
03:38:04,000 --> 03:38:06,200
I can see the Shire.

1713
03:38:08,600 --> 03:38:10,800
The Brandywine River.

1714
03:38:13,000 --> 03:38:14,900
Bag End.

1715
03:38:17,300 --> 03:38:19,900
Gandalf's fireworks.

1716
03:38:20,500 --> 03:38:24,100
The lights in the Party Tree.

1717
03:38:25,700 --> 03:38:28,700
Rosie Cotton dancing.

1718
03:38:30,000 --> 03:38:32,600
She had ribbons in her hair.

1719
03:38:35,600 --> 03:38:38,400
If ever I was to marry someone...

1720
03:38:39,400 --> 03:38:41,600
... it would've been her.

1721
03:38:43,200 --> 03:38:45,100
It would've been her.

1722
03:38:57,400 --> 03:39:00,500
I'm glad to be with you,
Samwise Gamgee...

1723
03:39:04,900 --> 03:39:07,700
...here at the end of all things.

1724
03:40:57,500 --> 03:40:59,400
Gandalf?

1725
03:41:19,200 --> 03:41:21,100
Frodo!

1726
03:41:41,000 --> 03:41:42,700
Gimli!

1727
03:43:25,700 --> 03:43:29,300
Now come the days of the king.

1728
03:43:34,500 --> 03:43:36,700
May they be blessed.

1729
03:43:57,100 --> 03:43:59,600
This day does not belong to one man...

1730
03:43:59,900 --> 03:44:01,700
...but to all.

1731
03:44:03,500 --> 03:44:06,300
Let us together rebuild this world...

1732
03:44:06,600 --> 03:44:10,600
...that we may share
in the days of peace.

1733
03:46:45,300 --> 03:46:47,300
My friends...

1734
03:46:52,700 --> 03:46:55,200
...you bow to no one.

1735
03:47:39,500 --> 03:47:41,500
And thus it was.

1736
03:47:41,800 --> 03:47:45,300
A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.

1737
03:47:45,600 --> 03:47:48,100
And the Fellowship of the Ring...

1738
03:47:48,300 --> 03:47:52,600
...though eternally bound
by friendship and love...

1739
03:47:53,000 --> 03:47:55,300
...was ended.

1740
03:48:00,400 --> 03:48:05,000
Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf
sent us on our long journey...

1741
03:48:05,400 --> 03:48:09,400
...we found ourselves
looking upon a familiar sight.

1742
03:48:12,200 --> 03:48:14,800
We were home.

1743
03:48:21,400 --> 03:48:23,100
Hi.

1744
03:48:40,400 --> 03:48:42,500
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

1745
03:49:30,800 --> 03:49:32,300
More of the same, Rosie.

1746
03:49:32,500 --> 03:49:34,400
Good night, lads.

1747
03:50:32,100 --> 03:50:35,900
How do you pick up the threads
of an old life?

1748
03:50:37,400 --> 03:50:39,500
How do you go on...

1749
03:50:39,800 --> 03:50:44,800
...when in your heart
you begin to understand...

1750
03:50:46,300 --> 03:50:49,100
...there is no going back?

1751
03:50:49,900 --> 03:50:53,400
There are some things
that time cannot mend...

1752
03:50:54,100 --> 03:50:56,900
...some hurts that go too deep...

1753
03:50:58,800 --> 03:51:01,500
...that have taken hold.

1754
03:51:22,200 --> 03:51:25,100
there and back again...
a hobbit's tale, by Bilbo Baggins

1755
03:51:39,800 --> 03:51:41,600
Mr. Frodo?

1756
03:51:45,000 --> 03:51:46,300
What is it?

1757
03:51:48,200 --> 03:51:52,000
It's been four years to the day
since Weathertop, Sam.

1758
03:51:52,800 --> 03:51:55,400
It's never really healed.

1759
03:51:59,500 --> 03:52:04,500
"There and Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale
by Bilbo Baggins.

1760
03:52:05,500 --> 03:52:09,100
And The Lord of the Rings
by Frodo Baggins."

1761
03:52:09,800 --> 03:52:11,900
You finished it.

1762
03:52:14,800 --> 03:52:16,300
Not quite.

1763
03:52:17,200 --> 03:52:19,600
There's room for a little more.

1764
03:52:22,300 --> 03:52:26,400
Bilbo once told me his part
in this tale would end...

1765
03:52:26,700 --> 03:52:29,900
...that each of us must come and go
in the telling.

1766
03:52:30,800 --> 03:52:33,500
Bilbo's story was now over.

1767
03:52:34,200 --> 03:52:37,000
There would be no more journeys
for him...

1768
03:52:37,300 --> 03:52:38,800
...save one.

1769
03:52:39,600 --> 03:52:43,000
Tell me again, lad,
where are we going?

1770
03:52:43,400 --> 03:52:45,300
To the harbour, Bilbo.

1771
03:52:45,500 --> 03:52:48,100
The Elves have accorded you
a special honour...

1772
03:52:48,400 --> 03:52:50,900
...a place on the last ship
to leave Middle-earth.

1773
03:52:52,700 --> 03:52:54,300
Frodo...

1774
03:52:55,900 --> 03:53:00,200
...any chance of seeing
that old Ring of mine again?

1775
03:53:01,000 --> 03:53:03,200
The one I gave you.

1776
03:53:06,900 --> 03:53:08,900
I'm sorry, Uncle.

1777
03:53:11,600 --> 03:53:14,100
I'm afraid I lost it.

1778
03:53:14,400 --> 03:53:16,100
Oh.

1779
03:53:16,800 --> 03:53:18,200
Pity.

1780
03:53:21,000 --> 03:53:24,700
I should like to have held it
one last time.

1781
03:53:54,000 --> 03:53:58,800
Well, here's a sight
I have never seen before.

1782
03:54:13,200 --> 03:54:16,400
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

1783
03:54:17,400 --> 03:54:20,100
The time has come...

1784
03:54:20,300 --> 03:54:23,500
...for the dominion of Men.

1785
03:54:24,800 --> 03:54:27,500
The sea calls us home.

1786
03:54:36,100 --> 03:54:38,100
I think I'm...

1787
03:54:38,400 --> 03:54:42,600
...quite ready
for another adventure.

1788
03:55:13,800 --> 03:55:16,000
Farewell...

1789
03:55:16,300 --> 03:55:18,900
...my brave Hobbits.

1790
03:55:21,000 --> 03:55:22,900
My work is now finished.

1791
03:55:26,900 --> 03:55:31,500
Here at last,
on the shores of the sea...

1792
03:55:32,500 --> 03:55:35,200
...comes the end of our Fellowship.

1793
03:55:38,800 --> 03:55:41,200
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

1794
03:55:42,100 --> 03:55:45,900
...for not all tears are an evil.

1795
03:56:03,500 --> 03:56:05,400
It is time, Frodo.

1796
03:56:11,000 --> 03:56:12,900
What does he mean?

1797
03:56:15,500 --> 03:56:18,200
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

1798
03:56:20,000 --> 03:56:22,600
And it has been saved.

1799
03:56:26,400 --> 03:56:29,000
But not for me.

1800
03:56:30,000 --> 03:56:32,300
You don't mean that.

1801
03:56:33,700 --> 03:56:35,700
You can't leave.

1802
03:56:44,200 --> 03:56:46,800
The last pages are for you, Sam.

1803
04:00:20,000 --> 04:00:22,700
My dear Sam:

1804
04:00:24,800 --> 04:00:27,900
You cannot always be torn in two.

1805
04:00:28,300 --> 04:00:32,300
You will have to be one and whole
for many years.

1806
04:00:33,200 --> 04:00:38,400
You have so much to enjoy
and to be and to do.

1807
04:00:39,800 --> 04:00:42,900
Your part in the story will go on.

1808
04:00:43,800 --> 04:00:45,500
Well...

1809
04:00:47,500 --> 04:00:49,100
... I'm back.

1810
04:02:31,700 --> 04:02:35,500
Lay down

1811
04:02:37,300 --> 04:02:41,500
Your sweet and weary head

1812
04:02:43,500 --> 04:02:46,900
Night is falling

1813
04:02:47,700 --> 04:02:52,400
You have come
To journey's end

1814
04:02:53,200 --> 04:02:56,800
Sleep now

1815
04:02:57,200 --> 04:03:02,600
And dream
Of the ones who came before

1816
04:03:04,600 --> 04:03:08,300
They are calling

1817
04:03:08,600 --> 04:03:12,600
From across
The distant shore

1818
04:03:14,400 --> 04:03:19,100
Why do you weep?

1819
04:03:19,500 --> 04:03:24,300
What are these tears
Upon your face?

1820
04:03:24,600 --> 04:03:29,500
Soon you will see

1821
04:03:29,800 --> 04:03:34,600
All ofyour fears
Will pass away

1822
04:03:35,000 --> 04:03:39,800
Safe in my arms

1823
04:03:40,200 --> 04:03:44,500
You're only sleeping

1824
04:03:44,900 --> 04:03:49,700
What can you see

1825
04:03:50,000 --> 04:03:55,100
On the horizon?

1826
04:03:55,400 --> 04:03:59,700
Why do the white gulls

1827
04:04:00,100 --> 04:04:04,600
Call?

1828
04:04:06,100 --> 04:04:10,500
Across the sea

1829
04:04:10,900 --> 04:04:15,900
A pale moon rises

1830
04:04:16,300 --> 04:04:18,800
The ships have come

1831
04:04:19,100 --> 04:04:24,700
To carry you home

1832
04:04:27,100 --> 04:04:31,500
And all will turn

1833
04:04:31,900 --> 04:04:37,000
To silver glass

1834
04:04:37,400 --> 04:04:41,500
A light on the water

1835
04:04:41,800 --> 04:04:47,000
All souls pass

1836
04:04:47,500 --> 04:04:51,500
Hope fades

1837
04:04:53,200 --> 04:04:57,900
Into the world of night

1838
04:04:58,800 --> 04:05:02,500
Through shadows falling

1839
04:05:03,500 --> 04:05:08,400
Out of memory and time

1840
04:05:09,400 --> 04:05:13,000
Don't say

1841
04:05:13,800 --> 04:05:18,600
We have come now to the end

1842
04:05:19,700 --> 04:05:24,000
White shores are calling

1843
04:05:24,300 --> 04:05:27,700
You and I will meet again

1844
04:05:28,000 --> 04:05:34,200
And you'll be here
In my arms

1845
04:05:35,700 --> 04:05:39,600
Just sleeping

1846
04:05:39,900 --> 04:05:44,600
What can you see

1847
04:05:44,900 --> 04:05:49,700
On the horizon?

1848
04:05:50,100 --> 04:05:54,600
Why do the white gulls

1849
04:05:55,000 --> 04:06:00,200
Call?

1850
04:06:00,700 --> 04:06:05,500
Across the sea

1851
04:06:05,900 --> 04:06:10,700
A pale moon rises

1852
04:06:11,100 --> 04:06:13,700
The ships have come

1853
04:06:14,000 --> 04:06:20,100
To carry you home

1854
04:06:21,600 --> 04:06:26,500
And all will turn

1855
04:06:27,200 --> 04:06:31,900
To silver glass

1856
04:06:32,300 --> 04:06:36,300
A light on the water

1857
04:06:36,600 --> 04:06:40,300
Grey ships pass

1858
04:06:40,600 --> 04:06:46,100
Into the West
